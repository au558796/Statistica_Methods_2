WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, Mister Trump, welcome
WALLACE	 Let's get right to it
WALLACE	 The first topic is the Supreme Court
WALLACE	You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate, but I want to drill down on this, because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments
WALLACE	 Which means that you will, in effect, determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century
WALLACE	First of all, where do you want to see the court take the country
WALLACE	 And secondly, what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted
WALLACE	 Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances
WALLACE	 In this segment, Secretary Clinton, you go first
WALLACE	 You have two minutes
CLINTON	 Thank you very much, Chris
CLINTON	 And thanks to UNLV for hosting us
CLINTON	You know, I think when we talk about the Supreme Court, it really raises the central issue in this election, namely, what kind of country are we going to be
CLINTON	 What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens
CLINTON	 What kind of rights will Americans have
CLINTON	And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people, not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy
CLINTON	 For me, that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights, on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community, that will stand up and say no to Citizens United, a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark, unaccountable money to come into our electoral system
CLINTON	I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court
CLINTON	 But I feel that at this point in our country's history, it is important that we not reverse marriage equality, that we not reverse Roe v
CLINTON	 Wade, that we stand up against Citizens United, we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace, that we stand up and basically say: The Supreme Court should represent all of us
CLINTON	That's how I see the court, and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful, standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans
CLINTON	And I look forward to having that opportunity
CLINTON	 I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them
CLINTON	 That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate
CLINTON	 The president nominates, and then the Senate advises and consents, or not, but they go forward with the process
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, thank you
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, same question
WALLACE	 Where do you want to see the court take the country
WALLACE	 And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted
TRUMP	 Well, first of all, it's great to be with you, and thank you, everybody
TRUMP	 The Supreme Court: It's what it's all about
TRUMP	 Our country is so, so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices
TRUMP	Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very, very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people, many, many millions of people that I represent
TRUMP	 And she was forced to apologize
TRUMP	 And apologize she did
TRUMP	 But these were statements that should never, ever have been made
TRUMP	We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment, and all amendments, but the Second Amendment, which is under absolute siege
TRUMP	 I believe if my opponent should win this race, which I truly don't think will happen, we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very, very small replica of what it is right now
TRUMP	 But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold, because of the fact that it is under such trauma
TRUMP	I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life
TRUMP	 They will have a conservative bent
TRUMP	 They will be protecting the Second Amendment
TRUMP	 They are great scholars in all cases, and they're people of tremendous respect
TRUMP	 They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted
TRUMP	 And I believe that's very, very important
TRUMP	I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear
TRUMP	 It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important, the Constitution the way it was meant to be
TRUMP	 And those are the people that I will appoint
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, thank you
WALLACE	 We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion
WALLACE	 I want to focus on two issues that, in fact, by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land
WALLACE	 First is one that you mentioned, Mister Trump, and that is guns
WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, you said last year, let me quote, "The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment
WALLACE	" And now, in fact, in the 2008 Heller case, the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms, but a right that is reasonably limited
WALLACE	 Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision
WALLACE	 What's wrong with that
CLINTON	 Well, first of all, I support the Second Amendment
CLINTON	 I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years
CLINTON	 I represented upstate New York
CLINTON	 I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership
CLINTON	 It goes back to the founding of our country
CLINTON	But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation
CLINTON	 Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you, kill you or members of your family
CLINTON	And so when I think about what we need to do, we have 33,000 people a year who die from guns
CLINTON	 I think we need comprehensive background checks, need to close the online loophole, close the gun show loophole
CLINTON	 There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment
CLINTON	You mentioned the Heller decision
CLINTON	 And what I was saying that you referenced, Chris, was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case, because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them
CLINTON	 And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation, but they've accepted many others
CLINTON	 So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment
WALLACE	 Let me bring Mister Trump in here
WALLACE	 The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here, and this was, in fact, one of the top questions that they got
WALLACE	 How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected
WALLACE	 You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer
WALLACE	 Does she persuade you that, while you may disagree on regulation, that, in fact, she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms
WALLACE	 TRUMP: Well, the DC vs Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it
WALLACE	 I watched
WALLACE	 I mean, she was very, very angry when upheld
WALLACE	 And Justice Scalia was so involved
WALLACE	 And it was a well-crafted decision
WALLACE	 But Hillary was extremely upset, extremely angry
WALLACE	 And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say
WALLACE	 Well, let me bring in Secretary Clinton
WALLACE	 Were you extremely upset
CLINTON	 Well, I was upset because, unfortunately, dozens of toddlers injure themselves, even kill people with guns, because, unfortunately, not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions
CLINTON	But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment, that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms
CLINTON	 That is not in conflict with sensible, commonsense regulation
CLINTON	And, you know, look, I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA
CLINTON	 The gun lobby's on his side
CLINTON	 They're running millions of dollars of ads against me
CLINTON	 And I regret that, because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say: Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment
CLINTON	 But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33,000 lives that we lose every year
WALLACE	 Let me bring Mister Trump back into this, because, in fact, you oppose any limits on assault weapons, any limits on high- capacity magazines
WALLACE	 You support a national right to carry law
WALLACE	 Why, sir
TRUMP	 Well, let me just tell you before we go any further
TRUMP	 In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city
TRUMP	 So we have the toughest laws, and you have tremendous gun violence
TRUMP	I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment
TRUMP	 And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner, but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA
TRUMP	 And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president
TRUMP	 So I'm very honored by all of that
TRUMP	We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment
TRUMP	 We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment, that will not do damage to the Second Amendment
WALLACE	 Well, let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there, and that's the issue of abortion
TRUMP	 Right
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, you're pro-life
WALLACE	 But I want to ask you specifically: Do you want the court, including the justices that you will name, to overturn Roe v
WALLACE	 Wade, which includes -- in fact, states -- a woman's right to abortion
TRUMP	 Well, if that would happen, because I am pro-life, and I will be appointing pro-life judges, I would think that that will go back to the individual states
WALLACE	 But I'm asking you specifically
WALLACE	 Would you like to
TRUMP	 If they overturned it, it will go back to the states
WALLACE	 But what I'm asking you, sir, is, do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment
WALLACE	 Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v
WALLACE	 Wade
TRUMP	 Well, if we put another two or perhaps three justice on, that's really what's going to be -- that will happen
TRUMP	 And that'll happen automatically, in my opinion, because I am putting pro-life justices on the court
TRUMP	 I will say this: It will go back to the states, and the states will then make a determination
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton
CLINTON	 Well, I strongly support Roe v
CLINTON	 Wade, which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate, most difficult, in many cases, decisions about her health care that one can imagine
CLINTON	 And in this case, it's not only about Roe v
CLINTON	 Wade
CLINTON	 It is about what's happening right now in America
CLINTON	So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood, which, of course, provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country
CLINTON	Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood
CLINTON	 He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood
CLINTON	 I will defend Planned Parenthood
CLINTON	 I will defend Roe v
CLINTON	 Wade, and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton
WALLACE	 CLINTON: And we have come too far to have that turned back now
WALLACE	 And, indeed, he said women should be punished, that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions
WALLACE	 And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking
WALLACE	 I'm going to give you a chance to respond, but I want to ask you, Secretary Clinton, I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes
WALLACE	 You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights
WALLACE	 You also voted against a ban on late-term, partial-birth abortions
WALLACE	 Why
CLINTON	 Because Roe v
CLINTON	 Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account
CLINTON	 And when I voted as a senator, I did not think that that was the case
CLINTON	The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking, painful decisions for families to make
CLINTON	 I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get, that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy
CLINTON	 I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions
CLINTON	 So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, your reaction
WALLACE	 And particularly on this issue of late-term, partial-birth abortions
TRUMP	 Well, I think it's terrible
TRUMP	 If you go with what Hillary is saying, in the ninth month, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby
TRUMP	Now, you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK
TRUMP	 But it's not OK with me, because based on what she's saying, and based on where she's going, and where she's been, you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day
TRUMP	 And that's not acceptable
CLINTON	 Well, that is not what happens in these cases
CLINTON	 And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate
CLINTON	 You should meet with some of the women that I have met with, women I have known over the course of my life
CLINTON	 This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make
CLINTON	 And I do not believe the government should be making it
CLINTON	You know, I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country
CLINTON	 I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions, like they used to do in China, or forced women to bear children, like they used to do in Romania
CLINTON	 And I can tell you: The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith, with medical advice
CLINTON	 And I will stand up for that right
WALLACE	 All right
WALLACE	 But just briefly, I want to move on to another segment
TRUMP	 And, honestly, nobody has business doing what I just said, doing that, as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth
TRUMP	 Nobody has that
WALLACE	 All right
WALLACE	 Let's move on to the subject of immigration
WALLACE	 And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration
WALLACE	 Actually, there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you
WALLACE	Mister Trump, you want to build a wall
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, you are calling for major deportations
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship
WALLACE	 The question, really, is, why are you right and your opponent wrong
WALLACE	Mister Trump, you go first in this segment
WALLACE	 You have two minutes
TRUMP	 Well, first of all, she wants to give amnesty, which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many, many years
TRUMP	 We need strong borders
TRUMP	In the audience tonight, we have four mothers of -- I mean, these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed, brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally
TRUMP	 You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country
TRUMP	 They're coming in illegally
TRUMP	 Drugs are pouring in through the border
TRUMP	 We have no country if we have no border
TRUMP	Hillary wants to give amnesty
TRUMP	 She wants to have open borders
TRUMP	 The border -- as you know, the Border Patrol agents, 16,500-plus ICE last week, endorsed me
TRUMP	 First time they've ever endorsed a candidate
TRUMP	 It means their job is tougher
TRUMP	 But they know what's going on
TRUMP	 They know it better than anybody
TRUMP	 They want strong borders
TRUMP	 They feel we have to have strong borders
TRUMP	I was up in New Hampshire the other day
TRUMP	 The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world, many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama
TRUMP	 All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border
TRUMP	 It's just pouring and destroying their youth
TRUMP	 It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people
TRUMP	 We have to have strong borders
TRUMP	 We have to keep the drugs out of our country
TRUMP	 We are -- right now, we're getting the drugs, they're getting the cash
TRUMP	 We need strong borders
TRUMP	 We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty
TRUMP	Now, I want to build the wall
TRUMP	 We need the wall
TRUMP	 And the Border Patrol, ICE, they all want the wall
TRUMP	 We stop the drugs
TRUMP	 We shore up the border
TRUMP	 One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords, all of the bad ones -- we have some bad, bad people in this country that have to go out
TRUMP	 We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border
TRUMP	 And once the border is secured, at a later date, we'll make a determination as to the rest
TRUMP	 But we have some bad hombres here, and we're going to get them out
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, thank you
WALLACE	 Same question to you, Secretary Clinton
WALLACE	 Basically, why are you right and Mister Trump is wrong
CLINTON	 Well, as he was talking, I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas, Carla, who is very worried that her parents might be deported, because she was born in this country but they were not
CLINTON	 They work hard, they do everything they can to give her a good life
CLINTON	And you're right
CLINTON	 I don't want to rip families apart
CLINTON	 I don't want to be sending parents away from children
CLINTON	 I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country
CLINTON	We have 11 million undocumented people
CLINTON	 They have 4 million American citizen children, 15 million people
CLINTON	 He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation
CLINTON	 Now, here's what that means
CLINTON	 It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence, where law enforcement officers would be going school to school, home to home, business to business, rounding up people who are undocumented
CLINTON	 And we would then have to put them on trains, on buses to get them out of our country
CLINTON	I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation
CLINTON	 I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart
CLINTON	I have been for border security for years
CLINTON	 I voted for border security in the United States Senate
CLINTON	 And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security
CLINTON	 But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed: Getting rid of any violent person
CLINTON	 Anybody who should be deported, we should deport them
CLINTON	When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building, he went to Mexico, he had a meeting with the Mexican president
CLINTON	 Didn't even raise it
CLINTON	 He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall
CLINTON	So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly
CLINTON	 And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship
WALLACE	 Thank you, Secretary Clinton
WALLACE	 I want to follow up
TRUMP	 Chris, I think it's
WALLACE	 OK
TRUMP	 I think I should respond to that
TRUMP	 First of all, I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico
TRUMP	 Very nice man
TRUMP	 We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals
TRUMP	 Believe me
TRUMP	 The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind, signed by anybody
TRUMP	 It's a disaster
TRUMP	Hillary Clinton wanted the wall
TRUMP	 Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts
TRUMP	 Now, she never gets anything done, so naturally the wall wasn't built
TRUMP	 But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall
WALLACE	 Well, let me -- wait, wait, sir, let me
TRUMP	 We are a country of laws
TRUMP	 We either have -- and by the way
WALLACE	 Now, wait
WALLACE	 I'd like to hear from
TRUMP	 Well -- well, but she said one thing
WALLACE	 I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton
CLINTON	 I voted for border security, and there are
TRUMP	 And the wall
CLINTON	 There are some limited places where that was appropriate
CLINTON	 There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that
CLINTON	But it is clear, when you look at what Donald has been proposing, he started his campaign bashing immigrants, calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers, that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants
CLINTON	Now, what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows, putting them into the formal economy will be good, because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages
CLINTON	And Donald knows a lot about this
CLINTON	 He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower
CLINTON	 He underpaid undocumented workers, and when they complained, he basically said what a lot of employers do: "You complain, I'll get you deported"
CLINTON	I want to get everybody out of the shadows, get the economy working, and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers, which hurts them, but also hurts American workers
WALLACE	 Mister Trump
TRUMP	 President Obama has moved millions of people out
TRUMP	 Nobody knows about it, nobody talks about it
TRUMP	 But under Obama, millions of people have been moved out of this country
TRUMP	 They've been deported
TRUMP	 She doesn't want to say that, but that's what's happened, and that's what happened big league
TRUMP	As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't
TRUMP	 We're a country of laws
TRUMP	 We either have a border or we don't
TRUMP	Now, you can come back in and you can become a citizen
TRUMP	 But it's very unfair
TRUMP	 We have millions of people that did it the right way
TRUMP	 They're on line
TRUMP	 They're waiting
TRUMP	 We're going to speed up the process, big league, because it's very inefficient
TRUMP	 But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens
TRUMP	Very unfair that somebody runs across the border, becomes a citizen, under her plan, you have open borders
TRUMP	 You would have a disaster on trade, and you will have a disaster with your open borders
WALLACE	 I want to
TRUMP	 But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, I want to
CLINTON	 We will not have open borders
CLINTON	 That is
WALLACE	 Well, let me -- Secretary
CLINTON	 That is a rank mischaracterization
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton
CLINTON	 We will have secure borders, but we'll also have reform
CLINTON	 And this used to be a bipartisan issue
CLINTON	 Ronald Reagan was the last president
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, excuse me
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton
CLINTON	 to sign immigration reform, and George W
CLINTON	 Bush supported it, as well
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, I want to clear up your position on this issue, because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank, for which you were paid $225,000, we've learned from the WikiLeaks, that you said this, and I want to quote
WALLACE	 "My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders
WALLACE	" So that's the question
TRUMP	 Thank you
WALLACE	 That's the question
WALLACE	 Please quiet, everybody
WALLACE	 Is that your dream, open borders
WALLACE	 CLINTON: Well, if you went on to read the rest of the sentence, I was talking about energy
WALLACE	 You know, we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined
WALLACE	 And I do want us to have an electric grid, an energy system that crosses borders
WALLACE	 I think that would be a great benefit to us
WALLACE	But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks
WALLACE	 And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans
WALLACE	 They have hacked American websites, American accounts of private people, of institutions
WALLACE	 Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet
WALLACE	This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government, clearly, from Putin himself, in an effort, as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed, to influence our election
CLINTON	 So I actually think the most important question of this evening, Chris, is, finally, will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election, that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans, which he actually encouraged in the past
CLINTON	 Those are the questions we need answered
CLINTON	 We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before
WALLACE	 Well
TRUMP	 That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders, OK
TRUMP	 How did we get on to Putin
WALLACE	 Hold on -- hold on, wait
WALLACE	 Hold on, folks
WALLACE	 Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control
WALLACE	 Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people
TRUMP	 So just to finish on the borders
WALLACE	 Yes
TRUMP	 She wants open borders
TRUMP	 People are going to pour into our country
TRUMP	 People are going to come in from Syria
TRUMP	 She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama, and he has thousands and thousands of people
TRUMP	 They have no idea where they come from
TRUMP	And you see, we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country
TRUMP	 She won't even mention the words, and neither will President Obama
TRUMP	 So I just want to tell you, she wants open borders
TRUMP	Now we can talk about Putin
TRUMP	 I don't know Putin
TRUMP	 He said nice things about me
TRUMP	 If we got along well, that would be good
TRUMP	 If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS, that would be good
TRUMP	He has no respect for her
TRUMP	 He has no respect for our president
TRUMP	 And I'll tell you what: We're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads
TRUMP	 And she's playing chicken
TRUMP	 Look, Putin
WALLACE	 Wait, but
TRUMP	 from everything I see, has no respect for this person
CLINTON	 Well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States
TRUMP	 No puppet
TRUMP	 No puppet
CLINTON	 And it's pretty clear
TRUMP	 You're the puppet
CLINTON	 It's pretty clear you won't admit
TRUMP	 No, you're the puppet
CLINTON	 that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the Putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up NATO, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race
CLINTON	So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation
CLINTON	 We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election
CLINTON	 We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies, civilian and military, who have all concluded that these espionage attacks, these cyberattacks, come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election
CLINTON	 I find that deeply disturbing
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton
CLINTON	 And I think it's time you take a stand
TRUMP	 She has no idea whether it's Russia, China, or anybody else
CLINTON	 I am not quoting myself
TRUMP	 She has no idea
CLINTON	 I am quoting 17
TRUMP	 Hillary, you have no idea
CLINTON	 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian
TRUMP	 And our country has no idea
CLINTON	 agencies
TRUMP	 Yeah, I doubt it
TRUMP	 I doubt it
CLINTON	 Well, he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us
CLINTON	 I find that just absolutely
TRUMP	 She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way
WALLACE	 Mister Trump
TRUMP	 Excuse me
TRUMP	 Putin has outsmarted her in Syria
WALLACE	 Mister Trump
TRUMP	 He's outsmarted her every step of the way
WALLACE	 I do get to ask some questions
TRUMP	 Yes, that's fine
WALLACE	 And I would like to ask you this direct question
WALLACE	 The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks
WALLACE	 Even if you don't know for sure whether they are, do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election
TRUMP	 By Russia or anybody else
WALLACE	 You condemn their interference
TRUMP	 Of course I condemn
TRUMP	 Of course I -- I don't know Putin
TRUMP	 I have no idea
WALLACE	 I'm not asking -- I'm asking do you condemn
TRUMP	 I never met Putin
TRUMP	 This is not my best friend
TRUMP	 But if the United States got along with Russia, wouldn't be so bad
TRUMP	Let me tell you, Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way
TRUMP	 Whether it's Syria, you name it
TRUMP	 Missiles
TRUMP	 Take a look at the "start up" that they signed
TRUMP	 The Russians have said, according to many, many reports, I can't believe they allowed us to do this
TRUMP	 They create warheads, and we can't
TRUMP	 The Russians can't believe it
TRUMP	 She has been outsmarted by Putin
TRUMP	And all you have to do is look at the Middle East
TRUMP	 They've taken over
TRUMP	 We've spent $6 trillion
TRUMP	 They've taken over the Middle East
TRUMP	 She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever
WALLACE	 We're a long way away from immigration, but I'm going to let you finish this topic
WALLACE	 You got about 45 seconds
TRUMP	 And she always will be
CLINTON	 I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons
CLINTON	 This is a person who has been very cavalier, even casual about the use of nuclear weapons
CLINTON	 He's
TRUMP	 Wrong
TRUMP	 CLINTON: 
TRUMP	 advocated more countries getting them, Japan, Korea, even Saudi Arabia
TRUMP	 He said, well, if we have them, why don't we use them, which I think is terrifying
TRUMP	But here's the deal
TRUMP	 The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must be followed
TRUMP	 There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so
TRUMP	 And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and, in an unprecedented way, said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button
TRUMP	 I have 200 generals
WALLACE	 Very quickly
TRUMP	 and admirals, 21 endorsing me, 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients
TRUMP	 As far as Japan and other countries, we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries
TRUMP	 We are spending a fortune doing it
TRUMP	 They have the bargain of the century
TRUMP	All I said is, we have to renegotiate these agreements, because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia, Japan, Germany, South Korea, and many other places
TRUMP	 We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons
WALLACE	 OK
TRUMP	 Look, she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways
TRUMP	 This is just another lie
CLINTON	 Well, I'm just quoting you when you were asked
TRUMP	 There's no quote
TRUMP	 You're not going to find a quote from me
CLINTON	 about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia, you said, you know, go ahead, enjoy yourselves, folks
CLINTON	 That kind
TRUMP	 And defend yourselves
CLINTON	 of language -- well
TRUMP	 And defend yourselves
TRUMP	 I didn't say nuclear
TRUMP	 And defend yourself
CLINTON	 The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances
CLINTON	 Donald wants to tear up our alliances
CLINTON	 I think it makes the world safer and, frankly, it makes the United States safer
CLINTON	 I would work with our allies in Asia, in Europe, in the Middle East, and elsewhere
CLINTON	 That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace
WALLACE	 We're going to -- no, we are going to move on to the next topic, which is the economy
WALLACE	 And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration
WALLACE	 You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, in your plan, government plays a big role
WALLACE	 You see more government spending, more entitlements, more tax credits, more tax penalties
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation
TRUMP	 Yes
WALLACE	 We're going to drill down into this a little bit more
WALLACE	 But in this overview, please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not
WALLACE	 In this round, you go first, Secretary Clinton
CLINTON	 Well, I think when the middle class thrives, America thrives
CLINTON	 And so my plan is based on growing the economy, giving middle-class families many more opportunities
CLINTON	 I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II, jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing
CLINTON	 I think we can compete with high-wage countries, and I believe we should
CLINTON	 New jobs and clean energy, not only to fight climate change, which is a serious problem, but to create new opportunities and new businesses
CLINTON	I want us to do more to help small business
CLINTON	 That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from
CLINTON	 I want us to raise the national minimum wage, because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty
CLINTON	 And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do
CLINTON	I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college
CLINTON	 That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges, real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future
CLINTON	 I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125,000, you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted
CLINTON	And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is, because we are going to go where the money is
CLINTON	 Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top
CLINTON	 So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share
CLINTON	 We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country
CLINTON	That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs
CLINTON	 By contrast, Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3
CLINTON	5 million jobs
CLINTON	 Why
CLINTON	 Because his whole plan is to cut taxes, to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations, adding $20 trillion to our debt, and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before, because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids
CLINTON	So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities
CLINTON	 The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession
WALLACE	 Secretary, thank you
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's
TRUMP	 Well, first of all, before I start on my plan, her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes
TRUMP	 Her tax plan is a disaster
TRUMP	 And she can say all she wants about college tuition
TRUMP	 And I'm a big proponent
TRUMP	 We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition
TRUMP	 But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it
TRUMP	 We will have a massive, massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan
TRUMP	 But I'd like to start off where we left, because when I said Japan and Germany, and I'm -- not to single them out, but South Korea, these are very rich, powerful countries
TRUMP	 Saudi Arabia, nothing but money
TRUMP	 We protect Saudi Arabia
TRUMP	 Why aren't they paying
TRUMP	She immediately -- when she heard this, I questioned it, and I questioned NATO
TRUMP	 Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying
TRUMP	 Because they weren't paying
TRUMP	Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden, they're paying
TRUMP	 And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it
TRUMP	 All of a sudden, they're starting to pay up
TRUMP	 They have to pay up
TRUMP	 We're protecting people, they have to pay up
TRUMP	 And I'm a big fan of NATO
TRUMP	 But they have to pay up
TRUMP	She comes out and said, we love our allies, we think our allies are great
TRUMP	 Well, it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are
TRUMP	We have to tell Japan in a very nice way, we have to tell Germany, all of these countries, South Korea, we have to say, you have to help us out
TRUMP	 We have, during his regime, during President Obama's regime, we've doubled our national debt
TRUMP	 We're up to $20 trillion
TRUMP	So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals
TRUMP	 We're going to have a lot of free trade
TRUMP	 We're going to have free trade, more free trade than we have right now
TRUMP	 But we have horrible deals
TRUMP	 Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed, NAFTA, one of the worst deals ever
TRUMP	 Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy
TRUMP	You look at all of the places that I just left, you go to Pennsylvania, you go to Ohio, you go to Florida, you go to any of them
TRUMP	 You go upstate New York
TRUMP	 Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places
TRUMP	 We're bringing our jobs back
TRUMP	I am going to renegotiate NAFTA
TRUMP	 And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals
TRUMP	 We're going to have trade, but we're going -- we're going to terminate it, we're going to make a great trade deal
TRUMP	And if we can't, we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way, because it has been a disaster
TRUMP	 We are going to cut taxes massively
TRUMP	 We're going to cut business taxes massively
TRUMP	 They're going to start hiring people
TRUMP	 We're going to bring the $2
TRUMP	5 trillion
WALLACE	 Time, Mister Trump
TRUMP	 that's offshore back into the country
TRUMP	 We are going to start the engine rolling again, because
WALLACE	 Mister Trump
TRUMP	 right now, our country is dying at 1 percent GDP
CLINTON	 Well, let me translate that, if I can, Chris, because
TRUMP	 You can't
CLINTON	 the fact is, he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen, three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration
CLINTON	 I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign: I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250,000 or less
CLINTON	I also will not add a penny to the debt
CLINTON	 I have costed out what I'm going to do
CLINTON	 He will, through his massive tax cuts, add $20 trillion to the debt
CLINTON	Well, he mentioned the debt
CLINTON	 We know how to get control of the debt
CLINTON	 When my husband was president, we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt
CLINTON	 When President Obama came into office, he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression
CLINTON	 He has cut the deficit by two-thirds
CLINTON	So, yes, one of the ways you go after the debt, one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people
CLINTON	 So I do have investments, investments in new jobs, investments in education, skill training, and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead
CLINTON	 That's the kind of approach that will work
WALLACE	 Secretary
CLINTON	 Cutting taxes on the wealthy, we've tried that
CLINTON	 It has not worked the way that it has been promised
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, I want to pursue your plan, because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009, which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949
TRUMP	 Correct
WALLACE	 Thank you, sir
WALLACE	You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus
WALLACE	 So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus
CLINTON	 Well, it's a combination, Chris
CLINTON	 And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited, it was a real touch-and-go situation
CLINTON	 I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state
CLINTON	 I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy
CLINTON	I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy
CLINTON	 He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions
CLINTON	 But it was a terrible recession
CLINTON	So now we've dug ourselves out of it, we're standing, but we're not yet running
CLINTON	 So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up, not the top down
CLINTON	 That is not going to work
CLINTON	That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt, but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs, higher-paying jobs
CLINTON	 We're beginning to see some increase in incomes, and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs
CLINTON	 We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving, and that's what I believe I will be able to do
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up, that your idea, and you've talked about 25 million jobs created, 4 percent
TRUMP	 Over a 10-year period
WALLACE	 growth is unrealistic
WALLACE	 And they say -- you talk a lot about growing the energy industry
WALLACE	 They say with oil prices as low as they are right now, that's unrealistic, as well
WALLACE	 Your response, sir
TRUMP	 So I just left some high representatives of India
TRUMP	 They're growing at 8 percent
TRUMP	 China is growing at 7 percent
TRUMP	 And that for them is a catastrophically low number
TRUMP	We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level
TRUMP	 And I think it's going down
TRUMP	 Last week, as you know, the end of last week, they came out with an anemic jobs report
TRUMP	 A terrible jobs report
TRUMP	 In fact I said, is that the last jobs report before the election
TRUMP	 Because if it is, I should win easily, it was so bad
TRUMP	 The report was so bad
TRUMP	Look, our country is stagnant
TRUMP	 We've lost our jobs
TRUMP	 We've lost our businesses
TRUMP	 We're not making things anymore, relatively speaking
TRUMP	 Our product is pouring in from China, pouring in from Vietnam, pouring in from all over the world
TRUMP	I've visited so many communities
TRUMP	 This has been such an incredible education for me, Chris
TRUMP	 I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year
TRUMP	 And they cry when they see what's happened
TRUMP	 I pass factories that were thriving 20, 25 years ago, and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent, it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities
TRUMP	Now, she can say that her husband did well, but, boy, did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in, because it didn't really kick in very much, but it kicked in after they left
TRUMP	 Boy, did they suffer
TRUMP	 That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country
TRUMP	Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership
TRUMP	 And she wants it
TRUMP	 She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates
TRUMP	 She totally lied
TRUMP	 She did call it the gold standard
TRUMP	 And they actually fact checked, and they said I was right
TRUMP	 I was so honored
WALLACE	 I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that, and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy
TRUMP	 And that will be as bad as NAFTA
WALLACE	 which is Obamacare
WALLACE	 But go ahead, briefly
CLINTON	 Well, first, let me say, number one, when I saw the final agreement for TPP, I said I was against it
CLINTON	 It didn't meet my test
CLINTON	 I've had the same test
CLINTON	 Does it create jobs, raise incomes, and further our national security
CLINTON	 I'm against it now
CLINTON	 I'll be against it after the election
CLINTON	 I'll be against it when I'm president
CLINTON	There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico, because that's Donald
CLINTON	 He's shipped jobs to 12 countries, including Mexico
CLINTON	But he mentioned China
CLINTON	 And, you know, one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets
CLINTON	 I have fought against that as a senator
CLINTON	 I've stood up against it as secretary of state
CLINTON	Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum
CLINTON	 In fact, the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel
CLINTON	 So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is, but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers, not American steelworkers
WALLACE	 Mister Trump
CLINTON	 That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work
TRUMP	 Well, let me just say -- let me just say
CLINTON	 We're going to pull the country together
CLINTON	 We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce
CLINTON	 That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history
CLINTON	 And we're going to enforce those agreements, and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton
WALLACE	 Go ahead, Mister Trump
TRUMP	 Let me ask a simple question
TRUMP	 She's been doing this for 30 years
TRUMP	 Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15, 20 years
CLINTON	 No, I voted
TRUMP	 You were very much involved -- excuse me
TRUMP	 My turn
TRUMP	 You were very much involved in every aspect of this country
TRUMP	 Very much
TRUMP	 And you do have experience
TRUMP	 I say the one thing you have over me is experience, but it's bad experience, because what you've done has turned out badly
TRUMP	For 30 years, you've been in a position to help, and if you say that I use steel or I use something else, I -- make it impossible for me to do that
TRUMP	 I wouldn't mind
TRUMP	The problem is, you talk, but you don't get anything done, Hillary
TRUMP	 You don't
TRUMP	 Just like when you ran the State Department, $6 billion was missing
TRUMP	 How do you miss $6 billion
TRUMP	 You ran the State Department, $6 billion was either stolen
TRUMP	 They don't know
TRUMP	 It's gone, $6 billion
TRUMP	 If you become president, this country is going to be in some mess
TRUMP	 Believe me
CLINTON	 Well, first of all, what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue, it's been debunked numerous times
CLINTON	 But I think it's really an important issue
CLINTON	 He raised the 30 years of experience, so let me just talk briefly about that
CLINTON	 You know, back in the 1970s, I worked for the Children's Defense Fund
CLINTON	 And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools
CLINTON	 He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings
CLINTON	In the 1980s, I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas
CLINTON	 He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses
CLINTON	 In the 1990s, I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights
CLINTON	 He insulted a former Miss Universe, Alicia Machado, called her an eating machine
TRUMP	 Give me a break
CLINTON	 And on the day when I was in the Situation Room, monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice, he was hosting the "Celebrity Apprentice
CLINTON	" So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience, what I've done for this country, trying to help in every way I could, especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead, with your 30 years, and I'll let the American people make that decision
TRUMP	 Well, I think I did a much better job
TRUMP	 I built a massive company, a great company, some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world, worth many, many billions of dollars
TRUMP	 I started with a $1 million loan
TRUMP	 I agree with that
TRUMP	 It's a $1 million loan
TRUMP	 But I built a phenomenal company
TRUMP	And if we could run our country the way I've run my company, we would have a country that you would be so proud of
TRUMP	 You would even be proud of it
TRUMP	And frankly, when you look at her real record, take a look at Syria
TRUMP	 Take a look at the migration
TRUMP	 Take a look at Libya
TRUMP	 Take a look at Iraq
TRUMP	 She gave us ISIS, because her and Obama created this huge vacuum, and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq, but once we were there, we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out
TRUMP	 She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there
TRUMP	 And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries
TRUMP	 And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS
TRUMP	 She's going to get rid of nobody
WALLACE	 All right
WALLACE	 We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments, but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, at the last debate, you said your talk about grabbing women was just that, talk, and that you'd never actually done it
WALLACE	 And since then, as we all know, nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent
WALLACE	Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years, why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this -- why would they all make up these stories
WALLACE	Since this is a question for both of you, Secretary Clinton, Mister Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, you go first
TRUMP	 Well, first of all, those stories have been largely debunked
TRUMP	 Those people -- I don't know those people
TRUMP	 I have a feeling how they came
TRUMP	 I believe it was her campaign that did it
TRUMP	Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence
TRUMP	 She's the one and Obama that caused the violence
TRUMP	 They hired people -- they paid them $1,500, and they're on tape saying be violent, cause fights, do bad things
TRUMP	I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false, I have to say that
TRUMP	 And I didn't even apologize to my wife, who's sitting right here, because I didn't do anything
TRUMP	 I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women
TRUMP	These women -- the woman on the plane, the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it
TRUMP	 And I think it's her campaign
TRUMP	 Because what I saw what they did, which is a criminal act, by the way, where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence
TRUMP	And I'll tell you what, in particular in Chicago, people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot
TRUMP	 And that was now all on tape, started by her
TRUMP	 I believe, Chris, that she got these people to step forward
TRUMP	 If it wasn't, they get their 10 minutes of fame
TRUMP	 But they were all totally -- it was all fiction
TRUMP	 It was lies, and it was fiction
CLINTON	 Well
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton
CLINTON	 At the last debate, we heard Donald talking about what he did to women
CLINTON	 And after that, a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them
CLINTON	 Now, what was his response
CLINTON	 Well, he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted
TRUMP	 I did not say that
TRUMP	 I did not say that
CLINTON	 In fact, he went on to say
CLINTON	 WALLACE: Her two minutes -- sir, her two minutes
CLINTON	 Her two minutes
TRUMP	 I did not say that
WALLACE	 It's her two minutes
CLINTON	 He went on to say, "Look at her
CLINTON	 I don't think so
CLINTON	" About another woman, he said, "That wouldn't be my first choice
CLINTON	" He attacked the woman reporter writing the story, called her "disgusting," as he has called a number of women during this campaign
CLINTON	Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger
CLINTON	 He goes after their dignity, their self-worth, and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like
CLINTON	 So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women
CLINTON	 That's who Donald is
CLINTON	I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is, and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president, how we want to bring our country together, where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other, where instead we celebrate our diversity, we lift people up, and we make our country even greater
CLINTON	America is great, because America is good
CLINTON	 And it really is up to all of us to make that true, now and in the future, and particularly for our children and our grandchildren
WALLACE	 Mister Trump
TRUMP	 Nobody has more respect for women than I do
TRUMP	 Nobody
TRUMP	(LAUGHTER)
TRUMP	Nobody has more respect
WALLACE	 Please, everybody
TRUMP	 And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked
TRUMP	 And I really want to just talk about something slightly different
TRUMP	She mentions this, which is all fiction, all fictionalized, probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign
TRUMP	 But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails, where she destroyed 33,000 e-mails criminally, criminally, after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress
TRUMP	What happened to the FBI, I don't know
TRUMP	 We have a great general, four-star general, today you read it in all of the papers, going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI
TRUMP	 One lie
TRUMP	 She's lied hundreds of times to the people, to Congress, and to the FBI
TRUMP	 He's going to probably go to jail
TRUMP	 This is a four-star general
TRUMP	 And she gets away with it, and she can run for the presidency of the United States
TRUMP	 That's really what you should be talking about, not fiction, where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton
CLINTON	 Well, every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable, like what these women are saying, he immediately goes to denying responsibility
CLINTON	 And it's not just about women
CLINTON	 He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything
CLINTON	So we know what he has said and what he's done to women
CLINTON	 But he also went after a disabled reporter, mocked and mimicked him on national television
TRUMP	 Wrong
CLINTON	 He went after Mister and Mister
CLINTON	 Khan, the parents of a young man who died serving our country, a Gold Star family, because of their religion
CLINTON	 He went after John McCain, a prisoner of war, said he prefers "people who aren't captured
CLINTON	" He went after a federal judge, born in Indiana, but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican
CLINTON	So it's not one thing
CLINTON	 This is a pattern, a pattern of divisiveness, of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country, where he incites violence, where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies
CLINTON	 That is not who America is
CLINTON	And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign, more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election
CLINTON	 It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have
TRUMP	 So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies, and she caused the violence
TRUMP	 It's on tape
WALLACE	 During the last
TRUMP	 The other things are false, but honestly, I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS, and I'd love to talk about other things
WALLACE	 OK
TRUMP	 but those other charges, as she knows, are false
WALLACE	 In this bucket about fitness to be president, there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate
WALLACE	 I'd like to ask you about them
WALLACE	 These are questions that the American people have
WALLACE	Secretary Clinton, during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing, you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state, but e-mails show that donors got special access to you
WALLACE	 Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors, and some of those donors got contracts, government contracts, taxpayer money
WALLACE	Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee
WALLACE	 And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation, why isn't it what Mister Trump calls pay to play
CLINTON	 Well, everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values
CLINTON	 The State Department has said that
CLINTON	 I think that's been proven
CLINTON	But I am happy, in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation, because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does
CLINTON	 You know, I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that
CLINTON	But just briefly, the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment, and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment
CLINTON	 In partnership with the American Health Association
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton
CLINTON	 we have made environments in schools healthier for kids, including healthier lunches
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, respectfully, this is -- this is an open discussion
CLINTON	 Well, it is an open discussion
CLINTON	 And you
WALLACE	 And the specific question went to pay for play
WALLACE	 Do you want to talk about that
CLINTON	 Well, but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is
TRUMP	 I think that it's been very well
WALLACE	 Let's ask Mister Trump
CLINTON	 There is a lot of evidence about the very good work
TRUMP	 It's been very well studied
CLINTON	 and the high rankings
WALLACE	 Please let me Mister Trump speak
TRUMP	 and it's a criminal enterprise, and so many people know it
WALLACE	 Please let Mister Trump speak
TRUMP	 It's a criminal enterprise
TRUMP	 Saudi Arabia giving $25 million, Qatar, all of these countries
TRUMP	 You talk about women and women's rights
TRUMP	 So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings
TRUMP	 These are people that kill women and treat women horribly
TRUMP	 And yet you take their money
TRUMP	So I'd like to ask you right now, why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly
TRUMP	 Why don't you give back the money
TRUMP	 I think it would be a great gesture
TRUMP	Because she takes a tremendous amount of money
TRUMP	 And you take a look at the people of Haiti
TRUMP	 I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida
TRUMP	 And I want to tell you, they hate the Clintons, because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace
TRUMP	 And you know it, and they know it, and everybody knows it
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton
CLINTON	 Well, very quickly, we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country
CLINTON	 I'm very proud of that
CLINTON	 We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations
CLINTON	 And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation, which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald
CLINTON	 I mean, who does that
CLINTON	 It just was astonishing
CLINTON	But when it comes to Haiti, Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere
CLINTON	 The earthquake and the hurricanes, it has devastated Haiti
CLINTON	 Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years
CLINTON	 The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had
CLINTON	We have done things to help small businesses, agriculture, and so much else
CLINTON	 And we're going to keep working to help Haiti
WALLACE	 All right
CLINTON	 because it's an important part of the American experience
TRUMP	 They don't want you to help them anymore
TRUMP	 I'd like to mention one thing
TRUMP	 Trump Foundation, small foundation
TRUMP	 People contribute, I contribute
TRUMP	 The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities, including a lot of military
TRUMP	 I don't get anything
TRUMP	 I don't buy boats
TRUMP	 I don't buy planes
TRUMP	 What happens -- the money goes to them
WALLACE	 Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits, sir
TRUMP	 No, it was -- we put up the American flag
TRUMP	 And that's it
TRUMP	 They put up the American flag
TRUMP	 We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag
WALLACE	 Right
WALLACE	 But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County, and the money came from your foundation
TRUMP	 There was
TRUMP	 There was
TRUMP	 And, by the way
WALLACE	 instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself, sir
TRUMP	 the money -- the money went to Fisher House, where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House, where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets
WALLACE	 I want to get into one
CLINTON	 But, of course, there's no way we can know whether any of that is true, because he hasn't released his tax returns
CLINTON	 He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns, so everything he says about charity or anything else, we can't prove it
CLINTON	 You can look at our tax returns
CLINTON	 We've got them all out there
CLINTON	But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax
CLINTON	 And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago, Chris
CLINTON	 You know, half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax
CLINTON	 So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire
CLINTON	 I find that just astonishing
WALLACE	 I want
TRUMP	 So let me just tell you very quickly, we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges, and we do it
TRUMP	 And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars, Soros, George Soros, took hundreds of millions of dollars
WALLACE	 We
TRUMP	 Let me just explain
WALLACE	 But, no, we heard this
TRUMP	 Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, we -- OK
TRUMP	 You know what she should have done
WALLACE	 Folks, we heard this
TRUMP	 And you know, Hillary, what you should have done, you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator
WALLACE	 Folks, we heard this
TRUMP	 because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do, except even more so
CLINTON	 Well, you know
TRUMP	 You should have changed the law
TRUMP	 But you won't change the law, because you take in so much money
TRUMP	 I mean, I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump
CLINTON	 Made with Chinese steel
TRUMP	 But I will tell you, I sat there
TRUMP	 I sat there watching ad after ad after ad, false ad
TRUMP	 All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them
TRUMP	 And, frankly, you should have changed the laws
WALLACE	 Mister Trump
TRUMP	 If you don't like what I did, you should have changed the laws
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, I want to ask you about one last question in this topic
WALLACE	 You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you
WALLACE	Your running mate, Governor Pence, pledged on Sunday that he and you -- his words -- "will absolutely accept the result of this election
WALLACE	" Today your daughter, Ivanka, said the same thing
WALLACE	 I want to ask you here on the stage tonight: Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir, that you will absolutely accept the result of this election
TRUMP	 I will look at it at the time
TRUMP	 I'm not looking at anything now
TRUMP	 I'll look at it at the time
TRUMP	What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad
TRUMP	 First of all, the media is so dishonest and so corrupt, and the pile-on is so amazing
TRUMP	 The New York Times actually wrote an article about it, but they don't even care
TRUMP	 It's so dishonest
TRUMP	 And they've poisoned the mind of the voters
TRUMP	But unfortunately for them, I think the voters are seeing through it
TRUMP	 I think they're going to see through it
TRUMP	 We'll find out on November 8th
TRUMP	 But I think they're going to see through it
WALLACE	 But, sir, there's
TRUMP	 If you look -- excuse me, Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls, you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions, this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote
TRUMP	So let me just give you one other thing
TRUMP	 So I talk about the corrupt media
TRUMP	 I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing
TRUMP	 She shouldn't be allowed to run
TRUMP	 It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very, very serious crime
TRUMP	 She should not be allowed to run
TRUMP	And just in that respect, I say it's rigged, because she should never
WALLACE	 But
TRUMP	 Chris, she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things
WALLACE	 But, sir, there is a tradition in this country -- in fact, one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is, that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner
WALLACE	 Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner, but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country
WALLACE	 Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle
TRUMP	 What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time
TRUMP	 I'll keep you in suspense
TRUMP	 OK
CLINTON	 Well, Chris, let me respond to that, because that's horrifying
CLINTON	 You know, every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction, he claims whatever it is, is rigged against him
CLINTON	The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails
CLINTON	 They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged
CLINTON	 He lost the Iowa caucus
CLINTON	 He lost the Wisconsin primary
CLINTON	 He said the Republican primary was rigged against him
CLINTON	 Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him
CLINTON	 There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him
TRUMP	 Should have gotten it
CLINTON	 This is -- this is a mindset
CLINTON	 This is how Donald thinks
CLINTON	 And it's funny, but it's also really troubling
WALLACE	 OK
CLINTON	 So that is not the way our democracy works
CLINTON	 We've been around for 240 years
CLINTON	 We've had free and fair elections
CLINTON	 We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them
CLINTON	 And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election
CLINTON	 You know, President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished
WALLACE	 Hold on
WALLACE	 Hold on, folks
WALLACE	 Hold on, folks
CLINTON	 it just shows you're not up to doing the job
CLINTON	 And let's -- you know, let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means
CLINTON	 He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy
CLINTON	 And I, for one, am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position
TRUMP	 I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did, including meeting with her husband, the attorney general, in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona, I think it's disgraceful
TRUMP	 I think it's a disgrace
WALLACE	 All right
TRUMP	 I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country
WALLACE	 Hold on, folks
WALLACE	 This doesn't do any good for anyone
WALLACE	 Let's please continue the debate, and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots
WALLACE	The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun
WALLACE	 If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq, the question then becomes, what happens the day after
WALLACE	 And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront
WALLACE	Will you put US troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, you go first in this segment
WALLACE	 You have two minutes
CLINTON	 Well, I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army, supported by Kurdish forces, and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground
CLINTON	 But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force
CLINTON	 I don't think that is in our interest, and I don't think that would be smart to do
CLINTON	 In fact, Chris, I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself
CLINTON	The goal here is to take back Mosul
CLINTON	 It's going to be a hard fight
CLINTON	 I've got no illusions about that
CLINTON	 And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa, which is the ISIS headquarters
CLINTON	I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation
CLINTON	 But we know we've got lots of work to do
CLINTON	 Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war, aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians, continue
CLINTON	So I have said, look, we need to keep our eye on ISIS
CLINTON	 That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home, why we have to go after them from the air, on the ground, online, why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons
CLINTON	 If you're too dangerous to fly, you're too dangerous to buy a gun
CLINTON	And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees, but to, frankly, gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, same question
WALLACE	 If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq, will -- would you be willing to put US troops in there to prevent their return or something else
TRUMP	 Let me tell you, Mosul is so sad
TRUMP	 We had Mosul
TRUMP	 But when she left, when she took everybody out, we lost Mosul
TRUMP	 Now we're fighting again to get Mosul
TRUMP	 The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul
TRUMP	About three months ago, I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul
TRUMP	 Whatever happened to the element of surprise, OK
TRUMP	 We announce we're going after Mosul
TRUMP	 I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it, Hillary, three months
TRUMP	 These people have all left
TRUMP	 They've all left
TRUMP	The element of surprise
TRUMP	 Douglas MacArthur, George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country
TRUMP	 So we're now fighting for Mosul, that we had
TRUMP	 All she had to do was stay there, and now we're going in to get it
TRUMP	But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it
TRUMP	 And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough
TRUMP	 They want to look good
TRUMP	 He violated the red line in the sand, and he made so many mistakes, made all the mistakes
TRUMP	 That's why we have the great migration
TRUMP	 But she wanted to look good for the election
TRUMP	 So they're going in
TRUMP	But who's going to get Mosul, really
TRUMP	 We'll take Mosul eventually
TRUMP	 But the way -- if you look at what's happening, much tougher than they thought
TRUMP	 Much, much tougher
TRUMP	 Much more dangerous
TRUMP	 Going to be more deaths that they thought
TRUMP	But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart
TRUMP	 They say, what do we need this for
TRUMP	 So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing
TRUMP	 And Iran should write us a letter of thank you, just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time, a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons
TRUMP	 Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much, because Iran, as I said many years ago, Iran is taking over Iraq, something they've wanted to do forever, but we've made it so easy for them
TRUMP	So we're now going to take Mosul
TRUMP	 And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary
TRUMP	 Iran
TRUMP	 Oh, yeah, they're making -- I mean, they are outsmarting -- look, you're not there, you might be involved in that decision
TRUMP	 But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq
TRUMP	 You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but you did vote for it
TRUMP	 You shouldn't have been in Iraq, but once you were in Iraq, you should have never left the way
WALLACE	 Sir, your two minutes are up
TRUMP	 The point is, the big winner is going to be Iran
CLINTON	 Well, you know, once again, Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq
CLINTON	 I said it was a mistake
CLINTON	 I've said that years ago
CLINTON	 He has consistently denied what is
TRUMP	 Wrong
CLINTON	 a very clear fact that
TRUMP	 Wrong
CLINTON	 before the invasion, he supported it
CLINTON	 And, you know, I just want everybody to go Google it
CLINTON	 Google "Donald Trump Iraq
CLINTON	" And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq
TRUMP	 Wrong
CLINTON	 And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that
CLINTON	 Now, why does that matter
CLINTON	 Well, it matters because he has not told the truth about that position
CLINTON	 I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it
CLINTON	But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay
CLINTON	 Mosul is a Sunni city
CLINTON	 Mosul is on the border of Syria
CLINTON	 And, yes, we do need to go after Baghdadi, and -- just like we went after bin Laden, while you were doing "Celebrity Apprentice," and we brought him to justice
CLINTON	 We need to go after the leadership
CLINTON	But we need to get rid of them, get rid of their fighters
CLINTON	 There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul
CLINTON	 They've been digging underground
CLINTON	 They've been prepared to defend
CLINTON	 It's going to be tough fighting
CLINTON	 But I think we can take back Mosul, and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa
CLINTON	This is what we have to do
CLINTON	 I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election, but that's how Donald thinks
CLINTON	 You know, he always is looking for some conspiracy
TRUMP	 Chris, we don't gain anything
CLINTON	 He has all the conspiracy theories
TRUMP	 Iran is taking over Iraq
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, it's
TRUMP	 Iran is taking over Iraq
TRUMP	 We don't gain anything
CLINTON	 This conspiracy theory, which he's been spewing out for quite some time
TRUMP	 If they did it by surprise
WALLACE	 Wait, wait, wait, Secretary Clinton, it's an open discussion
CLINTON	 He says
TRUMP	 We could have gained if they did it by surprise
WALLACE	 Secretary, please let Mister Trump speak
CLINTON	 unfit, and he proves it every time he talks
TRUMP	 No, you are the one that's unfit
TRUMP	 You know, WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you, and, boy, was he right
TRUMP	 He said some beauties
TRUMP	 And you know, Bernie Sanders, he said you have bad judgment
TRUMP	 You do
TRUMP	And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in, and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone
TRUMP	 If you think that was good, then you do
TRUMP	 Now, John Podesta said you have terrible instincts
TRUMP	 Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment
TRUMP	 I agree with both
CLINTON	 Well, you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president
CLINTON	 And he has said
TRUMP	 Which is a big mistake
CLINTON	 as he has campaigned for me around the country, you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America
CLINTON	 I think he's right
WALLACE	 Let's turn to Aleppo
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, in the last debate, you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo
WALLACE	 And I want to follow up on that, because you said several things in that debate which were not true, sir
WALLACE	 You said that Aleppo has basically fallen
WALLACE	 In fact, there -- in fact, there are
WALLACE	 TRUMP: It's a catastrophe
WALLACE	 I mean
WALLACE	 It's a catastrophe, but there
TRUMP	 it's a mess
WALLACE	 There are a quarter of
TRUMP	 Have you seen it
TRUMP	 Have you seen it
WALLACE	 Sir
TRUMP	 Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo
WALLACE	 Sir, if I may finish my question
TRUMP	 OK, so it hasn't fallen
TRUMP	 Take a look at it
WALLACE	 Well, there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered
TRUMP	 That's right
TRUMP	 And they are being slaughtered
WALLACE	 Yes
TRUMP	 because of bad decisions
WALLACE	 If I may just finish here, and you also said that -- that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS
WALLACE	 In fact, they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo, and they just announced a humanitarian pause, in effect, admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo
WALLACE	 Would you like to clear that up, sir
TRUMP	 Well, Aleppo is a disaster
TRUMP	 It's a humanitarian nightmare
TRUMP	 But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint
TRUMP	 I mean, what do you need, a signed document
TRUMP	 Take a look at Aleppo
TRUMP	 It is so sad when you see what's happened
TRUMP	And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton, because what's happened is, by fighting Assad, who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought, and now she's going to say, oh, he loves Assad, she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama
TRUMP	 And everyone thought he was gone two years ago, three years ago
TRUMP	 He -- he aligned with Russia
TRUMP	He now also aligned with Iran, who we made very powerful
TRUMP	 We gave them $150 billion back
TRUMP	 We give them $1,7 billion in cash
TRUMP	 I mean, cash
TRUMP	 Bundles of cash as big as this stage
TRUMP	 We gave them $1,7 billion
TRUMP	Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran
TRUMP	 They don't want ISIS, but they have other things, because we're backing -- we're backing rebels
TRUMP	 We don't know who the rebels are
TRUMP	 We're giving them lots of money, lots of everything
TRUMP	 We don't know who the rebels are
TRUMP	 And when and if -- and it's not going to happen, because you have Russia and you have Iran now
TRUMP	 But if they ever did overthrow Assad, you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is, and he's a bad guy, but you may very well end up with worse than Assad
TRUMP	If she did nothing, we'd be in much better shape
TRUMP	 And this is what's caused the great migration, where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees, who probably in many cases -- not probably, who are definitely
WALLACE	 Let me
TRUMP	 in many cases, ISIS-aligned, and we now have them in our country, and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse
TRUMP	 And wait until you see what happens in the coming years
TRUMP	 Lots of luck, Hillary
TRUMP	 Thanks a lot for doing a great job
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there
WALLACE	 President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict
WALLACE	And General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, says you impose a no-fly zone, chances are you're going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia
WALLACE	 So the question I have is, if you impose a no-fly zone -- first of all, how do you respond to their concerns
WALLACE	 Secondly, if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that, does President Clinton shoot that plane down
CLINTON	 Well, Chris, first of all, I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict
CLINTON	 I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general
CLINTON	This would not be done just on the first day
CLINTON	 This would take a lot of negotiation
CLINTON	 And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground
CLINTON	We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated
CLINTON	 So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria, it would help us with our fight against ISIS
CLINTON	But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees
CLINTON	 He's made these claims repeatedly
CLINTON	 I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted, who we do not have confidence in
CLINTON	 But I am not going to slam the door on women and children
CLINTON	 That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo, with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance, is haunting
CLINTON	 And so we are going to do very careful, thorough vetting
CLINTON	 That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization, to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks
CLINTON	 In fact, the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando, the Pulse nightclub, was born in Queens, the same place Donald was born
CLINTON	 So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it
CLINTON	And, yes, some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq, and we've got to keep fighting, and I will defeat ISIS, and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home
WALLACE	 Folks, I want to get into our final segment
TRUMP	 But I just have to
WALLACE	 Real quick
TRUMP	 It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS
TRUMP	 We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place
TRUMP	 And right now, they're in 32 countries
WALLACE	 OK
TRUMP	 We should have -- wait one second
TRUMP	 They had a cease-fire three weeks ago
TRUMP	 A cease-fire, the United States, Russia, and Syria
TRUMP	 And during the cease-fire, Russia took over vast swatches of land, and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore
TRUMP	We are so outplayed on missiles, on cease-fires
TRUMP	 They are outplayed
TRUMP	 Now, she wasn't there
TRUMP	 I assume she had nothing to do with it
TRUMP	 But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad, and by the way -- and by Iran
TRUMP	 Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, Secretary Clinton -- no, we need to move on to our final segment, and that is the national debt, which has not been discussed until tonight
WALLACE	Our national debt, as a share of the economy, our GDP, is now 77 percent
WALLACE	 That's the highest since just after World War II
WALLACE	 But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says, Secretary Clinton, under your plan, debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, under your plan, they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years
WALLACE	 The question is, why are both of you ignoring this problem
WALLACE	 Mister Trump, you go first
TRUMP	 Well, I say they're wrong, because I'm going to create tremendous jobs
TRUMP	 And we're bringing GDP from, really, 1 percent, which is what it is now, and if she got in, it will be less than zero
TRUMP	 But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent
TRUMP	 And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent
TRUMP	 I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent
TRUMP	 And if we do, you don't have to bother asking your question, because we have a tremendous machine
TRUMP	 We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again
TRUMP	 To do that, we're taking back jobs
TRUMP	 We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs, we don't make our product anymore
TRUMP	 It's very sad
TRUMP	 But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry
TRUMP	 We used to be there
TRUMP	 We've given it up
TRUMP	 We've become very, very sloppy
TRUMP	We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world, bigger than companies
TRUMP	 You take these big companies, these trade deals are far bigger than these companies, and yet we don't use our great leaders, many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary, I must say
TRUMP	 But we don't use those people
TRUMP	 Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world
TRUMP	 We have the greatest businesspeople in the world
TRUMP	 We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals
TRUMP	We use political hacks
TRUMP	 We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are
TRUMP	 So we have to use our great people
TRUMP	But that being said, we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades
TRUMP	 And people, Chris, will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money
TRUMP	 And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton
CLINTON	 Well, first, when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is "Make America Great Again," I wonder when he thought America was great
CLINTON	 And before he rushes and says, "You know, before you and President Obama were there," I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades
CLINTON	You know, back in 1987, he took out a $100,000 ad in the New York Times, during the time when President Reagan was president, and basically said exactly what he just said now, that we were the laughingstock of the world
CLINTON	 He was criticizing President Reagan
CLINTON	 This is the way Donald thinks about himself, puts himself into, you know, the middle and says, "You know, I alone can fix it," as he said on the convention stage
CLINTON	But if you look at the debt, which is the issue you asked about, Chris, I pay for everything I'm proposing
CLINTON	 I do not add a penny to the national debt
CLINTON	 I take that very seriously, because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with
CLINTON	So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education, how we're going to invest in infrastructure, how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down, and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time, I've made it very clear we are going where the money is
CLINTON	 We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share
CLINTON	And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth
CLINTON	 In fact, I think just the opposite
CLINTON	 We'll have what economists call middle-out growth
CLINTON	 We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class, the families of America
CLINTON	 That's where growth will come from
CLINTON	 That's why I want to invest in you
CLINTON	 I want to invest in your family
CLINTON	And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy, to make the economy fairer
CLINTON	 And we just have a big disagreement about this
CLINTON	 It may be because of our experiences
CLINTON	 You know, he started off with his dad as a millionaire
TRUMP	 Yeah, yeah, we've heard -- we've heard this before, Hillary
CLINTON	 I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man
TRUMP	 We've heard this before
CLINTON	 And I think it -- you know, it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy
WALLACE	 Time
TRUMP	 Thank you, Hillary
TRUMP	 Could I just respond
WALLACE	 Well, no, sir, because we're running out of time
TRUMP	 Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade
TRUMP	 I disagreed with him
TRUMP	 We should have been much tougher on trade even then
TRUMP	 I've been waiting for years
TRUMP	 Nobody does it right
WALLACE	 OK
TRUMP	 And frankly, now we're going to do it right
WALLACE	 All right
WALLACE	 The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements, which is 60 percent of all federal spending
WALLACE	 Now, the Committee for federal -- a Responsible Federal Budget has looked at both of your plans and they say neither of you has a serious plan that is going to solve the fact that Medicare's going to run out of money in the 2020s, Social Security is going to run out of money in the 2030s, and at that time, recipients are going to take huge cuts in their benefits
WALLACE	So, in effect, the final question I want to ask you in this regard is -- and let me start with you, Mister Trump, would President Trump make a deal to save Medicare and Social Security that included both tax increases and benefit cuts, in effect, a grand bargain on entitlements
TRUMP	 I'm cutting taxes
TRUMP	 We're going to grow the economy
TRUMP	 It's going to grow at a record rate of growth
WALLACE	 That's not going to help in the entitlements
TRUMP	 No, it's going to totally help you
TRUMP	 And one thing we have to do: Repeal and replace the disaster known as Obamacare
TRUMP	 It's destroying our country
TRUMP	 It's destroying our businesses, our small business and our big businesses
TRUMP	 We have to repeal and replace Obamacare
TRUMP	You take a look at the kind of numbers that that will cost us in the year '17, it is a disaster
TRUMP	 If we don't repeal and replace -- now, it's probably going to die of its own weight
TRUMP	 But Obamacare has to go
TRUMP	 It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent, 70 percent, 80 percent
TRUMP	 Next year they're going to go up over 100 percent
TRUMP	And I'm really glad that the premiums have started -- at least the people see what's happening, because she wants to keep Obamacare and she wants to make it even worse, and it can't get any worse
TRUMP	 Bad health care at the most expensive price
TRUMP	 We have to repeal and replace Obamacare
WALLACE	 And, Secretary Clinton, same question, because at this point, Social Security and Medicare are going to run out, the trust funds are going to run out of money
WALLACE	 Will you as president entertain -- will you consider a grand bargain, a deal that includes both tax increases and benefit cuts to try to save both programs
CLINTON	 Well, Chris, I am on record as saying that we need to put more money into the Social Security Trust Fund
CLINTON	 That's part of my commitment to raise taxes on the wealthy
CLINTON	 My Social Security payroll contribution will go up, as will Donald's, assuming he can't figure out how to get out of it
CLINTON	 But what we want to do is to replenish the Social Security Trust Fund
TRUMP	 Such a nasty woman
CLINTON	 by making sure that we have sufficient resources, and that will come from either raising the cap and/or finding other ways to get more money into it
CLINTON	 I will not cut benefits
CLINTON	 I want to enhance benefits for low-income workers and for women who have been disadvantaged by the current Social Security system
CLINTON	But what Donald is proposing with these massive tax cuts will result in a $20 trillion additional national debt
CLINTON	 That will have dire consequences for Social Security and Medicare
CLINTON	And I'll say something about the Affordable Care Act, which he wants to repeal
CLINTON	 The Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of the Medicare Trust Fund
CLINTON	 So if repeals it, our Medicare problem gets worse
CLINTON	 What we need to do is go after
TRUMP	 Your husband disagrees with you
CLINTON	 the long-term health care drivers
CLINTON	 We've got to get costs down, increase value, emphasize wellness
CLINTON	 I have a plan for doing that
CLINTON	 And I think that we will be able to get entitlement spending under control by with more resources and harder decisions
WALLACE	 This is -- this is the final time, probably to both of your delight, that you're going to be on a stage together in this campaign
WALLACE	 I would like to end it on a positive note
WALLACE	 You had not agreed to closing statements, but it seems to me in a funny way that might make it more interesting because you haven't prepared closing statements
WALLACE	So I'd like you each to take -- and we're going to put a clock up, a minute, as the final question in the final debate, to tell the American people why they should elect you to be the next president
WALLACE	 This is another new mini-segment
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, it's your turn to go first
CLINTON	 Well, I would like to say to everyone watching tonight that I'm reaching out to all Americans -- Democrats, Republicans, and independents -- because we need everybody to help make our country what it should be, to grow the economy, to make it fairer, to make it work for everyone
CLINTON	 We need your talents, your skills, your commitments, your energy, your ambition
CLINTON	You know, I've been privileged to see the presidency up close
CLINTON	 And I know the awesome responsibility of protecting our country and the incredible opportunity of working to try to make life better for all of you
CLINTON	 I have made the cause of children and families really my life's work
CLINTON	That's what my mission will be in the presidency
CLINTON	 I will stand up for families against powerful interests, against corporations
CLINTON	 I will do everything that I can to make sure that you have good jobs, with rising incomes, that your kids have good educations from preschool through college
CLINTON	 I hope you will give me a chance to serve as your president
WALLACE	 Secretary Clinton, thank you
WALLACE	Mister Trump
TRUMP	 She's raising the money from the people she wants to control
TRUMP	 Doesn't work that way
TRUMP	But when I started this campaign, I started it very strongly
TRUMP	 It's called "Make America Great Again
TRUMP	" We're going to make America great
TRUMP	 We have a depleted military
TRUMP	 It has to be helped, has to be fixed
TRUMP	 We have the greatest people on Earth in our military
TRUMP	 We don't take care of our veterans
TRUMP	 We take care of illegal immigrants, people that come into the country illegally, better than we take care of our vets
TRUMP	 That can't happen
TRUMP	Our policemen and women are disrespected
TRUMP	 We need law and order, but we need justice, too
TRUMP	 Our inner cities are a disaster
TRUMP	 You get shot walking to the store
TRUMP	 They have no education
TRUMP	 They have no jobs
TRUMP	 I will do more for African-Americans and Latinos than she can ever do in 10 lifetimes
TRUMP	All she's done is talk to the African-Americans and to the Latinos, but they get the vote, and then they come back, they say, we'll see you in four years
TRUMP	 We are going to make America strong again, and we are going to make America great again, and it has to start now
TRUMP	 We cannot take four more years of Barack Obama, and that's what you get when you get her
WALLACE	 Thank you both
