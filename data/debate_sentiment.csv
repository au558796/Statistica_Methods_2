1,WALLACE,Secretary Clinton Mister Trump welcome,0.424760320877
2,WALLACE, Let's get right to it,0.208760320877
3,WALLACE, The first topic is the Supreme Court,0.0247603208766
4,WALLACE,You both talked briefly about the court in the last debate but I want to drill down on this because the next president will almost certainly have at least one appointment and likely or possibly two or three appointments,-0.129329951989
5,WALLACE, Which means that you will in effect determine the balance of the court for what could be the next quarter century,-0.0295253934091
6,WALLACE,First of all where do you want to see the court take the country,0.120474606591
7,WALLACE, And secondly what's your view on how the Constitution should be interpreted,0.0068636274702
8,WALLACE, Do the founders' words mean what they say or is it a living document to be applied flexibly according to changing circumstances,-0.0602178901122
9,WALLACE, In this segment Secretary Clinton you go first,0.339760320877
10,WALLACE, You have two minutes,0.309760320877
11,CLINTON, Thank you very much Chris,0.768760320877
12,CLINTON, And thanks to UNLV for hosting us,0.389794560751
13,CLINTON,You know I think when we talk about the Supreme Court it really raises the central issue in this election namely what kind of country are we going to be,0.186760320877
14,CLINTON, What kind of opportunities will we provide for our citizens,0.688760320877
15,CLINTON, What kind of rights will Americans have,0.596188892305
16,CLINTON,And I feel strongly that the Supreme Court needs to stand on the side of the American people not on the side of the powerful corporations and the wealthy,0.00131204501452
17,CLINTON, For me that means that we need a Supreme Court that will stand up on behalf of women's rights on behalf of the rights of the LGBT community that will stand up and say no to Citizens United a decision that has undermined the election system in our country because of the way it permits dark unaccountable money to come into our electoral system,0.0684509208081
18,CLINTON,I have major disagreements with my opponent about these issues and others that will be before the Supreme Court,-0.0912796960117
19,CLINTON, But I feel that at this point in our country's history it is important that we not reverse marriage equality that we not reverse Roe v,-0.0154227683879
20,CLINTON, Wade that we stand up against Citizens United we stand up for the rights of people in the workplace that we stand up and basically say The Supreme Court should represent all of us,0.209774419649
21,CLINTON,That's how I see the court and the kind of people that I would be looking to nominate to the court would be in the great tradition of standing up to the powerful standing up on behalf of our rights as Americans,0.149885075141
22,CLINTON,And I look forward to having that opportunity,0.327260320877
23,CLINTON, I would hope that the Senate would do its job and confirm the nominee that President Obama has sent to them,0.0338307665074
24,CLINTON, That's the way the Constitution fundamentally should operate,-0.115834719233
25,CLINTON, The president nominates and then the Senate advises and consents or not but they go forward with the process,-0.168622887683
26,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton thank you,0.809760320877
27,WALLACE, Mister Trump same question,-0.105239679123
28,WALLACE, Where do you want to see the court take the country,-0.0152396791234
29,WALLACE, And how do you believe the Constitution should be interpreted,0.247760320877
30,TRUMP, Well first of all it's great to be with you and thank you everybody,0.703331749448
31,TRUMP, The Supreme Court It's what it's all about,-0.207739679123
32,TRUMP, Our country is so so -- it's just so imperative that we have the right justices,0.137617760712
33,TRUMP,Something happened recently where Justice Ginsburg made some very very inappropriate statements toward me and toward a tremendous number of people many many millions of people that I represent,0.326500988402
34,TRUMP, And she was forced to apologize,-0.515239679123
35,TRUMP, And apologize she did,0.124760320877
36,TRUMP, But these were statements that should never ever have been made,-0.337057860942
37,TRUMP,We need a Supreme Court that in my opinion is going to uphold the Second Amendment and all amendments but the Second Amendment which is under absolute siege,-0.0693211420745
38,TRUMP, I believe if my opponent should win this race which I truly don't think will happen we will have a Second Amendment which will be a very very small replica of what it is right now,0.21351697863
39,TRUMP, But I feel that it's absolutely important that we uphold because of the fact that it is under such trauma,-0.0607157112111
40,TRUMP,I feel that the justices that I am going to appoint -- and I've named 20 of them -- the justices that I'm going to appoint will be pro-life,-0.0172425262618
41,TRUMP, They will have a conservative bent,-0.0485730124567
42,TRUMP, They will be protecting the Second Amendment,0.267617463734
43,TRUMP, They are great scholars in all cases and they're people of tremendous respect,0.583221859338
44,TRUMP, They will interpret the Constitution the way the founders wanted it interpreted,-0.00853306593618
45,TRUMP, And I believe that's very very important,0.579046035162
46,TRUMP,I don't think we should have justices appointed that decide what they want to hear,0.0951096328181
47,TRUMP, It's all about the Constitution of -- of -- and so important the Constitution the way it was meant to be,-0.047121614445
48,TRUMP, And those are the people that I will appoint,0.0375647296681
49,WALLACE, Mister Trump thank you,0.719760320877
50,WALLACE, We now have about 10 minutes for an open discussion,0.202284288789
51,WALLACE, I want to focus on two issues that in fact by the justices that you name could end up changing the existing law of the land,-0.0231150760802
52,WALLACE, First is one that you mentioned Mister Trump and that is guns,-0.120239679123
53,WALLACE,Secretary Clinton you said last year let me quote "The Supreme Court is wrong on the Second Amendment,-0.107726363617
54,WALLACE," And now in fact in the 2008 Heller case the court ruled that there is a constitutional right to bear arms but a right that is reasonably limited,-0.0809045399038
55,WALLACE, Those were the words of the Judge Antonin Scalia who wrote the decision,-0.209818190028
56,WALLACE, What's wrong with that,-0.725239679123
57,CLINTON, Well first of all I support the Second Amendment,0.502538098654
58,CLINTON, I lived in Arkansas for 18 wonderful years,0.409165280767
59,CLINTON, I represented upstate New York,0.567808256701
60,CLINTON, I understand and respect the tradition of gun ownership,0.242538098654
61,CLINTON, It goes back to the founding of our country,0.0136492097655
62,CLINTON,But I also believe that there can be and must be reasonable regulation,0.029375705492
63,CLINTON, Because I support the Second Amendment doesn't mean that I want people who shouldn't have guns to be able to threaten you kill you or members of your family,-0.151955552257
64,CLINTON,And so when I think about what we need to do we have 33000 people a year who die from guns,-0.203085408689
65,CLINTON, I think we need comprehensive background checks need to close the online loophole close the gun show loophole,-0.0302130481097
66,CLINTON, There's other matters that I think are sensible that are the kind of reforms that would make a difference that are not in any way conflicting with the Second Amendment,-0.0648903671819
67,CLINTON,You mentioned the Heller decision,0.0398082567013
68,CLINTON, And what I was saying that you referenced Chris was that I disagreed with the way the court applied the Second Amendment in that case because what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns and so they wanted people with guns to safely store them,-0.169745082251
69,CLINTON, And the court didn't accept that reasonable regulation but they've accepted many others,-0.216778140662
70,CLINTON, So I see no conflict between saving people's lives and defending the Second Amendment,-0.096668250552
71,WALLACE, Let me bring Mister Trump in here,0.193331749448
72,WALLACE, The bipartisan Open Debate Coalition got millions of votes on questions to ask here and this was in fact one of the top questions that they got,0.0497691978812
73,WALLACE, How will you ensure the Second Amendment is protected,0.260315876432
74,WALLACE, You just heard Secretary Clinton's answer,0.33809365421
75,WALLACE, Does she persuade you that while you may disagree on regulation that in fact she supports a Second Amendment right to bear arms,0.127369016529
76,WALLACE, TRUMP Well the DC vs Heller decision was very strongly -- and she was extremely angry about it,-0.172435270332
77,WALLACE, I watched,0.314760320877
78,WALLACE, I mean she was very very angry when upheld,-0.344657492554
79,WALLACE, And Justice Scalia was so involved,0.0973002673972
80,WALLACE, And it was a well-crafted decision,-0.28936639927
81,WALLACE, But Hillary was extremely upset extremely angry,-1.05523967912
82,WALLACE, And people that believe in the Second Amendment and believe in it very strongly were very upset with what she had to say,0.0421516252244
83,WALLACE, Well let me bring in Secretary Clinton,0.416188892305
84,WALLACE, Were you extremely upset,-0.535239679123
85,CLINTON, Well I was upset because unfortunately dozens of toddlers injure themselves even kill people with guns because unfortunately not everyone who has loaded guns in their homes takes appropriate precautions,-0.498049044544
86,CLINTON,But there's no doubt that I respect the Second Amendment that I also believe there's an individual right to bear arms,-0.054287298171
87,CLINTON, That is not in conflict with sensible commonsense regulation,-0.531853083763
88,CLINTON,And you know look I understand that Donald's been strongly supported by the NRA,0.268365989323
89,CLINTON, The gun lobby's on his side,-0.472699732603
90,CLINTON, They're running millions of dollars of ads against me,0.182538098654
91,CLINTON, And I regret that because what I would like to see is for people to come together and say Of course we're going to protect and defend the Second Amendment,0.0534269875433
92,CLINTON, But we're going to do it in a way that tries to save some of these 33000 lives that we lose every year,-0.12762056264
93,WALLACE, Let me bring Mister Trump back into this because in fact you oppose any limits on assault weapons any limits on high- capacity magazines,-0.325438025827
94,WALLACE, You support a national right to carry law,0.314760320877
95,WALLACE, Why sir,-0.255239679123
96,TRUMP, Well let me just tell you before we go any further,0.42112395724
97,TRUMP, In Chicago which has the toughest gun laws in the United States probably you could say by far they have more gun violence than any other city,-0.242823394711
98,TRUMP, So we have the toughest laws and you have tremendous gun violence,-0.258969705863
99,TRUMP,I am a very strong supporter of the Second Amendment,0.354760320877
100,TRUMP, And I am -- I don't know if Hillary was saying it in a sarcastic manner but I'm very proud to have the endorsement of the NRA,-0.0426115785125
101,TRUMP, And it's the earliest endorsement they've ever given to anybody who ran for president,-0.0984368449003
102,TRUMP, So I'm very honored by all of that,0.269760320877
103,TRUMP,We are going to appoint justices -- this is the best way to help the Second Amendment,0.0745084995454
104,TRUMP, We are going to appoint justices that will feel very strongly about the Second Amendment that will not do damage to the Second Amendment,-0.0889697058631
105,WALLACE, Well let's pick up on another issue which divides you and the justices that whoever ends up winning this election appoints could have a dramatic effect there and that's the issue of abortion,-0.0896118295061
106,TRUMP, Right,1.16476032088
107,WALLACE, Mister Trump you're pro-life,-0.0214297593426
108,WALLACE, But I want to ask you specifically Do you want the court including the justices that you will name to overturn Roe v,0.011095931197
109,WALLACE, Wade which includes -- in fact states -- a woman's right to abortion,0.0452002468281
110,TRUMP, Well if that would happen because I am pro-life and I will be appointing pro-life judges I would think that that will go back to the individual states,0.0721074293541
111,WALLACE, But I'm asking you specifically,0.0207603208766
112,WALLACE, Would you like to,0.579760320877
113,TRUMP, If they overturned it it will go back to the states,-0.0993087992031
114,WALLACE, But what I'm asking you sir is do you want to see the court overturn -- you just said you want to see the court protect the Second Amendment,0.0306389194368
115,WALLACE, Do you want to see the court overturn Roe v,-0.0841917432987
116,WALLACE, Wade,0.0
117,TRUMP, Well if we put another two or perhaps three justice on that's really what's going to be -- that will happen,0.0978669722634
118,TRUMP, And that'll happen automatically in my opinion because I am putting pro-life justices on the court,-0.013334719233
119,TRUMP, I will say this It will go back to the states and the states will then make a determination,0.168970847192
120,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton,0.174760320877
121,CLINTON, Well I strongly support Roe v,0.493966934064
122,CLINTON, Wade which guarantees a constitutional right to a woman to make the most intimate most difficult in many cases decisions about her health care that one can imagine,0.283706012243
123,CLINTON, And in this case it's not only about Roe v,-0.409715711211
124,CLINTON, Wade,0.0
125,CLINTON, It is about what's happening right now in America,0.244760320877
126,CLINTON,So many states are putting very stringent regulations on women that block them from exercising that choice to the extent that they are defunding Planned Parenthood which of course provides all kinds of cancer screenings and other benefits for women in our country,0.0162998184491
127,CLINTON,Donald has said he's in favor of defunding Planned Parenthood,0.0558082567013
128,CLINTON, He even supported shutting the government down to defund Planned Parenthood,-0.105628857544
129,CLINTON, I will defend Planned Parenthood,0.327808256701
130,CLINTON, I will defend Roe v,0.0638082567013
131,CLINTON, Wade and I will defend women's rights to make their own health care decisions,0.502991726528
132,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton,0.174760320877
133,WALLACE, CLINTON And we have come too far to have that turned back now,0.0539910901074
134,WALLACE, And indeed he said women should be punished that there should be some form of punishment for women who obtain abortions,-0.0290263763498
135,WALLACE, And I could just not be more opposed to that kind of thinking,0.00168339779966
136,WALLACE, I'm going to give you a chance to respond but I want to ask you Secretary Clinton I want to explore how far you believe the right to abortion goes,0.0937603208766
137,WALLACE, You have been quoted as saying that the fetus has no constitutional rights,-0.0140673961139
138,WALLACE, You also voted against a ban on late-term partial-birth abortions,-0.298667775386
139,WALLACE, Why,-0.395239679123
140,CLINTON, Because Roe v,-0.363493119416
141,CLINTON, Wade very clearly sets out that there can be regulations on abortion so long as the life and the health of the mother are taken into account,-0.055415987304
142,CLINTON, And when I voted as a senator I did not think that that was the case,-0.168989679123
143,CLINTON,The kinds of cases that fall at the end of pregnancy are often the most heartbreaking painful decisions for families to make,-0.215456057345
144,CLINTON, I have met with women who toward the end of their pregnancy get the worst news one could get that their health is in jeopardy if they continue to carry to term or that something terrible has happened or just been discovered about the pregnancy,-0.0664565751429
145,CLINTON, I do not think the United States government should be stepping in and making those most personal of decisions,0.177391899824
146,CLINTON, So you can regulate if you are doing so with the life and the health of the mother taken into account,0.187390781787
147,WALLACE, Mister Trump your reaction,0.0897603208766
148,WALLACE, And particularly on this issue of late-term partial-birth abortions,-0.170159786082
149,TRUMP, Well I think it's terrible,-0.0712396791234
150,TRUMP, If you go with what Hillary is saying in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby,0.0980936542099
151,TRUMP,Now you can say that that's OK and Hillary can say that that's OK,0.133331749448
152,TRUMP, But it's not OK with me because based on what she's saying and based on where she's going and where she's been you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day,-0.0445420047048
153,TRUMP, And that's not acceptable,-0.117739679123
154,CLINTON, Well that is not what happens in these cases,-0.255239679123
155,CLINTON, And using that kind of scare rhetoric is just terribly unfortunate,-0.374287010192
156,CLINTON, You should meet with some of the women that I have met with women I have known over the course of my life,0.370847277398
157,CLINTON, This is one of the worst possible choices that any woman and her family has to make,0.0294662032295
158,CLINTON, And I do not believe the government should be making it,0.0120330481493
159,CLINTON,You know I've had the great honor of traveling across the world on behalf of our country,0.450642673818
160,CLINTON, I've been to countries where governments either forced women to have abortions like they used to do in China or forced women to bear children like they used to do in Romania,0.0569628008218
161,CLINTON, And I can tell you The government has no business in the decisions that women make with their families in accordance with their faith with medical advice,0.211056617173
162,CLINTON, And I will stand up for that right,0.324760320877
163,WALLACE, All right,1.00476032088
164,WALLACE, But just briefly I want to move on to another segment,-0.0370578609416
165,TRUMP, And honestly nobody has business doing what I just said doing that as late as one or two or three or four days prior to birth,-0.063701217585
166,TRUMP, Nobody has that,-0.788573012457
167,WALLACE, All right,1.00476032088
168,WALLACE, Let's move on to the subject of immigration,-0.0902396791234
169,WALLACE, And there is almost no issue that separates the two of you more than the issue of immigration,-0.34105969695
170,WALLACE, Actually there are a lot of issues that separate the two of you,-0.279855063739
171,WALLACE,Mister Trump you want to build a wall,0.137260320877
172,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton you have offered no specific plan for how you want to secure our southern border,0.205936791465
173,WALLACE, Mister Trump you are calling for major deportations,0.154165280767
174,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton you say that within your first 100 days as president you're going to offer a package that includes a pathway to citizenship,0.181665280767
175,WALLACE, The question really is why are you right and your opponent wrong,-0.228573012457
176,WALLACE,Mister Trump you go first in this segment,0.294760320877
177,WALLACE, You have two minutes,0.309760320877
178,TRUMP, Well first of all she wants to give amnesty which is a disaster and very unfair to all of the people that are waiting on line for many many years,-0.0800650231526
179,TRUMP, We need strong borders,0.434760320877
180,TRUMP,In the audience tonight we have four mothers of -- I mean these are unbelievable people that I've gotten to know over a period of years whose children have been killed brutally killed by people that came into the country illegally,-0.11619190555
181,TRUMP, You have thousands of mothers and fathers and relatives all over the country,0.5216833978
182,TRUMP, They're coming in illegally,0.138570240657
183,TRUMP, Drugs are pouring in through the border,-0.506668250552
184,TRUMP, We have no country if we have no border,-0.130795234679
185,TRUMP,Hillary wants to give amnesty,0.103808256701
186,TRUMP, She wants to have open borders,0.194760320877
187,TRUMP, The border -- as you know the Border Patrol agents 16500-plus ICE last week endorsed me,-0.0386322392878
188,TRUMP, First time they've ever endorsed a candidate,0.236188892305
189,TRUMP, It means their job is tougher,0.0139669340638
190,TRUMP, But they know what's going on,-0.0852396791234
191,TRUMP, They know it better than anybody,0.19809365421
192,TRUMP, They want strong borders,0.459760320877
193,TRUMP, They feel we have to have strong borders,0.442260320877
194,TRUMP,I was up in New Hampshire the other day,0.269204765321
195,TRUMP, The biggest complaint they have -- it's with all of the problems going on in the world many of the problems caused by Hillary Clinton and by Barack Obama,-0.237472793636
196,TRUMP, All of the problems -- the single biggest problem is heroin that pours across our southern border,-0.319609147513
197,TRUMP, It's just pouring and destroying their youth,0.0926517036085
198,TRUMP, It's poisoning the blood of their youth and plenty of other people,-0.0323030391965
199,TRUMP, We have to have strong borders,0.461426987543
200,TRUMP, We have to keep the drugs out of our country,-0.115239679123
201,TRUMP, We are -- right now we're getting the drugs they're getting the cash,0.13208645004
202,TRUMP, We need strong borders,0.434760320877
203,TRUMP, We need absolute -- we cannot give amnesty,0.0760702406574
204,TRUMP,Now I want to build the wall,0.150474606591
205,TRUMP, We need the wall,-0.0802396791234
206,TRUMP, And the Border Patrol ICE they all want the wall,0.00228428878893
207,TRUMP, We stop the drugs,-0.895239679123
208,TRUMP, We shore up the border,0.388760320877
209,TRUMP, One of my first acts will be to get all of the drug lords all of the bad ones -- we have some bad bad people in this country that have to go out,-0.168320865032
210,TRUMP, We're going to get them out; we're going to secure the border,0.0260302941369
211,TRUMP, And once the border is secured at a later date we'll make a determination as to the rest,0.134204765321
212,TRUMP, But we have some bad hombres here and we're going to get them out,-0.265579702043
213,WALLACE, Mister Trump thank you,0.719760320877
214,WALLACE, Same question to you Secretary Clinton,0.0680936542099
215,WALLACE, Basically why are you right and Mister Trump is wrong,-0.0992396791234
216,CLINTON, Well as he was talking I was thinking about a young girl I met here in Las Vegas Carla who is very worried that her parents might be deported because she was born in this country but they were not,0.124522304833
217,CLINTON, They work hard they do everything they can to give her a good life,0.386188892305
218,CLINTON,And you're right,0.311426987543
219,CLINTON, I don't want to rip families apart,-0.323811107695
220,CLINTON, I don't want to be sending parents away from children,0.190760320877
221,CLINTON, I don't want to see the deportation force that Donald has talked about in action in our country,-0.002170808061
222,CLINTON,We have 11 million undocumented people,0.706506880584
223,CLINTON, They have 4 million American citizen children 15 million people,0.913808256701
224,CLINTON, He said as recently as a few weeks ago in Phoenix that every undocumented person would be subject to deportation,-0.0677157112111
225,CLINTON, Now here's what that means,-0.0952396791234
226,CLINTON, It means you would have to have a massive law enforcement presence where law enforcement officers would be going school to school home to home business to business rounding up people who are undocumented,0.120950890237
227,CLINTON, And we would then have to put them on trains on buses to get them out of our country,0.0531813735082
228,CLINTON,I think that is an idea that is not in keeping with who we are as a nation,0.100315876432
229,CLINTON, I think it's an idea that would rip our country apart,-0.00251240639614
230,CLINTON,I have been for border security for years,0.0622603208766
231,CLINTON, I voted for border security in the United States Senate,0.264760320877
232,CLINTON, And my comprehensive immigration reform plan of course includes border security,0.155669411786
233,CLINTON, But I want to put our resources where I think they're most needed Getting rid of any violent person,-0.105765994913
234,CLINTON, Anybody who should be deported we should deport them,-0.0162975282071
235,CLINTON,When it comes to the wall that Donald talks about building he went to Mexico he had a meeting with the Mexican president,-0.0804570704278
236,CLINTON, Didn't even raise it,-0.0402396791234
237,CLINTON, He choked and then got into a Twitter war because the Mexican president said we're not paying for that wall,-0.344477695167
238,CLINTON,So I think we are both a nation of immigrants and we are a nation of laws and that we can act accordingly,0.196064668703
239,CLINTON, And that's why I'm introducing comprehensive immigration reform within the first 100 days with the path to citizenship,0.0595224896194
240,WALLACE, Thank you Secretary Clinton,0.809760320877
241,WALLACE, I want to follow up,0.304760320877
242,TRUMP, Chris I think it's,0.179760320877
243,WALLACE, OK,0.564760320877
244,TRUMP, I think I should respond to that,0.193331749448
245,TRUMP, First of all I had a very good meeting with the president of Mexico,0.339046035162
246,TRUMP, Very nice man,1.09142698754
247,TRUMP, We will be doing very much better with Mexico on trade deals,0.644760320877
248,TRUMP, Believe me,1.26476032088
249,TRUMP, The NAFTA deal signed by her husband is one of the worst deals ever made of any kind signed by anybody,0.0235812579777
250,TRUMP, It's a disaster,-1.34857301246
251,TRUMP,Hillary Clinton wanted the wall,-0.207239679123
252,TRUMP, Hillary Clinton fought for the wall in 2006 or thereabouts,-0.344191743299
253,TRUMP, Now she never gets anything done so naturally the wall wasn't built,0.0830936542099
254,TRUMP, But Hillary Clinton wanted the wall,-0.36190634579
255,WALLACE, Well let me -- wait wait sir let me,0.0375647296681
256,TRUMP, We are a country of laws,0.13809365421
257,TRUMP, We either have -- and by the way,0.011665280767
258,WALLACE, Now wait,-0.555239679123
259,WALLACE, I'd like to hear from,0.356760320877
260,TRUMP, Well -- well but she said one thing,0.314165280767
261,WALLACE, I'd like to hear -- I'd like to hear from Secretary Clinton,0.342696960804
262,CLINTON, I voted for border security and there are,0.0922603208766
263,TRUMP, And the wall,-0.315239679123
264,CLINTON, There are some limited places where that was appropriate,-0.213017456901
265,CLINTON, There also is necessarily going to be new technology and how best to deploy that,0.144442966151
266,CLINTON,But it is clear when you look at what Donald has been proposing he started his campaign bashing immigrants calling Mexican immigrants rapists and criminals and drug dealers that he has a very different view about what we should do to deal with immigrants,-0.0515815264758
267,CLINTON,Now what I am also arguing is that bringing undocumented immigrants out from the shadows putting them into the formal economy will be good because then employers can't exploit them and undercut Americans' wages,-0.130505599227
268,CLINTON,And Donald knows a lot about this,0.0619031780194
269,CLINTON, He used undocumented labor to build the Trump Tower,-0.18021304811
270,CLINTON, He underpaid undocumented workers and when they complained he basically said what a lot of employers do "You complain I'll get you deported",-0.136067561015
271,CLINTON,I want to get everybody out of the shadows get the economy working and not let employers like Donald exploit undocumented workers which hurts them but also hurts American workers,-0.216890367182
272,WALLACE, Mister Trump,-0.00523967912342
273,TRUMP, President Obama has moved millions of people out,0.252260320877
274,TRUMP, Nobody knows about it nobody talks about it,-0.427739679123
275,TRUMP, But under Obama millions of people have been moved out of this country,0.00629878241505
276,TRUMP, They've been deported,-0.243493119416
277,TRUMP, She doesn't want to say that but that's what's happened and that's what happened big league,-0.210239679123
278,TRUMP,As far as moving these people out and moving -- we either have a country or we don't,-0.0477263636166
279,TRUMP, We're a country of laws,0.0327603208766
280,TRUMP, We either have a border or we don't,-0.0627396791234
281,TRUMP,Now you can come back in and you can become a citizen,0.30809365421
282,TRUMP, But it's very unfair,-0.730239679123
283,TRUMP, We have millions of people that did it the right way,0.339305775422
284,TRUMP, They're on line,-0.0819063457901
285,TRUMP, They're waiting,-0.865239679123
286,TRUMP, We're going to speed up the process big league because it's very inefficient,0.17208645004
287,TRUMP, But they're on line and they're waiting to become citizens,-0.261239679123
288,TRUMP,Very unfair that somebody runs across the border becomes a citizen under her plan you have open borders,0.00253809865436
289,TRUMP, You would have a disaster on trade and you will have a disaster with your open borders,-0.124651443829
290,WALLACE, I want to,0.15809365421
291,TRUMP, But what she doesn't say is that President Obama has deported millions and millions of people just the way it is,0.0473907817872
292,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton I want to,0.164760320877
293,CLINTON, We will not have open borders,0.14809365421
294,CLINTON, That is,-0.315239679123
295,WALLACE, Well let me -- Secretary,0.511808256701
296,CLINTON, That is a rank mischaracterization,-0.0841917432987
297,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton,0.174760320877
298,CLINTON, We will have secure borders but we'll also have reform,0.286760320877
299,CLINTON, And this used to be a bipartisan issue,-0.295834719233
300,CLINTON, Ronald Reagan was the last president,-0.538573012457
301,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton excuse me,0.189760320877
302,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton,0.174760320877
303,CLINTON, to sign immigration reform and George W,-0.140953964838
304,CLINTON, Bush supported it as well,0.300760320877
305,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton I want to clear up your position on this issue because in a speech you gave to a Brazilian bank for which you were paid $225000 we've learned from the WikiLeaks that you said this and I want to quote,0.177390781787
306,WALLACE, "My dream is a hemispheric common market with open trade and open borders,0.297874117665
307,WALLACE," So that's the question,-0.236191743299
308,TRUMP, Thank you,1.44476032088
309,WALLACE, That's the question,-0.295239679123
310,WALLACE, Please quiet everybody,0.644760320877
311,WALLACE, Is that your dream open borders,0.271426987543
312,WALLACE, CLINTON Well if you went on to read the rest of the sentence I was talking about energy,0.283649209765
313,WALLACE, You know we trade more energy with our neighbors than we trade with the rest of the world combined,0.586865584034
314,WALLACE, And I do want us to have an electric grid an energy system that crosses borders,0.135415280767
315,WALLACE, I think that would be a great benefit to us,0.568760320877
316,WALLACE,But you are very clearly quoting from WikiLeaks,0.108570240657
317,WALLACE, And what's really important about WikiLeaks is that the Russian government has engaged in espionage against Americans,-0.0757997168736
318,WALLACE, They have hacked American websites American accounts of private people of institutions,0.302696960804
319,WALLACE, Then they have given that information to WikiLeaks for the purpose of putting it on the Internet,0.149186184354
320,WALLACE,This has come from the highest levels of the Russian government clearly from Putin himself in an effort as 17 of our intelligence agencies have confirmed to influence our election,0.125109632818
321,CLINTON, So I actually think the most important question of this evening Chris is finally will Donald Trump admit and condemn that the Russians are doing this and make it clear that he will not have the help of Putin in in this election that he rejects Russian espionage against Americans which he actually encouraged in the past,-0.00925794725511
322,CLINTON, Those are the questions we need answered,-0.0152396791234
323,CLINTON, We've never had anything like this happen in any of our elections before,-0.150624294508
324,WALLACE, Well,1.30476032088
325,TRUMP, That was a great pivot off the fact that she wants open borders OK,0.0844202979568
326,TRUMP, How did we get on to Putin,0.12122313218
327,WALLACE, Hold on -- hold on wait,-0.102699732603
328,WALLACE, Hold on folks,0.391426987543
329,WALLACE, Because we -- this is going to end up getting out of control,-0.104836626883
330,WALLACE, Let's try to keep it quiet so -- for the candidates and for the American people,0.0619628008218
331,TRUMP, So just to finish on the borders,0.0590460351623
332,WALLACE, Yes,1.36476032088
333,TRUMP, She wants open borders,0.279760320877
334,TRUMP, People are going to pour into our country,0.162260320877
335,TRUMP, People are going to come in from Syria,0.074165280767
336,TRUMP, She wants 550 percent more people than Barack Obama and he has thousands and thousands of people,0.233892066707
337,TRUMP, They have no idea where they come from,0.0772603208766
338,TRUMP,And you see we are going to stop radical Islamic terrorism in this country,-0.309525393409
339,TRUMP, She won't even mention the words and neither will President Obama,0.0156694117857
340,TRUMP, So I just want to tell you she wants open borders,0.235669411786
341,TRUMP,Now we can talk about Putin,0.373966934064
342,TRUMP, I don't know Putin,-0.101429759343
343,TRUMP, He said nice things about me,0.571426987543
344,TRUMP, If we got along well that would be good,0.402538098654
345,TRUMP, If Russia and the United States got along well and went after ISIS that would be good,0.203303831413
346,TRUMP,He has no respect for her,0.0380936542099
347,TRUMP, He has no respect for our president,0.136188892305
348,TRUMP, And I'll tell you what We're in very serious trouble because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1800 by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't 1800 nuclear warheads,-0.107144177047
349,TRUMP, And she's playing chicken,0.694760320877
350,TRUMP, Look Putin,0.0823801604383
351,WALLACE, Wait but,-1.38523967912
352,TRUMP, from everything I see has no respect for this person,0.118760320877
353,CLINTON, Well that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the United States,0.181903178019
354,TRUMP, No puppet,-0.685239679123
355,TRUMP, No puppet,-0.685239679123
356,CLINTON, And it's pretty clear,0.554760320877
357,TRUMP, You're the puppet,0.0180936542099
358,CLINTON, It's pretty clear you won't admit,0.154760320877
359,TRUMP, No you're the puppet,-0.460239679123
360,CLINTON, that the Russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the United States of America that you encouraged espionage against our people that you are willing to spout the Putin line sign up for his wish list break up NATO do whatever he wants to do and that you continue to get help from him because he has a very clear favorite in this race,0.149219983043
361,CLINTON,So I think that this is such an unprecedented situation,-0.0997157112111
362,CLINTON, We've never had a foreign government trying to interfere in our election,-0.19563637253
363,CLINTON, We have 17 -- 17 intelligence agencies civilian and military who have all concluded that these espionage attacks these cyberattacks come from the highest levels of the Kremlin and they are designed to influence our election,0.0373002673972
364,CLINTON, I find that deeply disturbing,0.223808256701
365,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton,0.174760320877
366,CLINTON, And I think it's time you take a stand,0.204760320877
367,TRUMP, She has no idea whether it's Russia China or anybody else,-0.166148770033
368,CLINTON, I am not quoting myself,-0.00819174329873
369,TRUMP, She has no idea,0.0997603208766
370,CLINTON, I am quoting 17,0.137380160438
371,TRUMP, Hillary you have no idea,0.168760320877
372,CLINTON, 17 intelligence -- do you doubt 17 military and civilian,0.0473322246136
373,TRUMP, And our country has no idea,0.174760320877
374,CLINTON, agencies,-0.455239679123
375,TRUMP, Yeah I doubt it,-0.375239679123
376,TRUMP, I doubt it,-0.675239679123
377,CLINTON, Well he'd rather believe Vladimir Putin than the military and civilian intelligence professionals who are sworn to protect us,0.236640270212
378,CLINTON, I find that just absolutely,0.408760320877
379,TRUMP, She doesn't like Putin because Putin has outsmarted her at every step of the way,-0.0295250766321
380,WALLACE, Mister Trump,-0.00523967912342
381,TRUMP, Excuse me,0.204760320877
382,TRUMP, Putin has outsmarted her in Syria,0.0657134937716
383,WALLACE, Mister Trump,-0.00523967912342
384,TRUMP, He's outsmarted her every step of the way,-0.070834719233
385,WALLACE, I do get to ask some questions,0.0247603208766
386,TRUMP, Yes that's fine,0.87809365421
387,WALLACE, And I would like to ask you this direct question,0.212760320877
388,WALLACE, The top national security officials of this country do believe that Russia has been behind these hacks,0.0880097137662
389,WALLACE, Even if you don't know for sure whether they are do you condemn any interference by Russia in the American election,0.039295543692
390,TRUMP, By Russia or anybody else,-0.339239679123
391,WALLACE, You condemn their interference,-0.00392975934256
392,TRUMP, Of course I condemn,0.0385702406574
393,TRUMP, Of course I -- I don't know Putin,-0.0314297593426
394,TRUMP, I have no idea,0.194760320877
395,WALLACE, I'm not asking -- I'm asking do you condemn,0.0259246940151
396,TRUMP, I never met Putin,-0.261429759343
397,TRUMP, This is not my best friend,0.474760320877
398,TRUMP, But if the United States got along with Russia wouldn't be so bad,-0.273701217585
399,TRUMP,Let me tell you Putin has outsmarted her and Obama at every single step of the way,0.077141459597
400,TRUMP, Whether it's Syria you name it,-0.0126997326028
401,TRUMP, Missiles,-2.55523967912
402,TRUMP, Take a look at the "start up" that they signed,-0.0881917432987
403,TRUMP, The Russians have said according to many many reports I can't believe they allowed us to do this,0.0569825430988
404,TRUMP, They create warheads and we can't,0.0973002673972
405,TRUMP, The Russians can't believe it,-0.311239679123
406,TRUMP, She has been outsmarted by Putin,-0.0201597860823
407,TRUMP,And all you have to do is look at the Middle East,0.124760320877
408,TRUMP, They've taken over,-0.68190634579
409,TRUMP, We've spent $6 trillion,-0.0926198395617
410,TRUMP, They've taken over the Middle East,-0.338573012457
411,TRUMP, She has been outsmarted and outplayed worse than anybody I've ever seen in any government whatsoever,-0.256132239288
412,WALLACE, We're a long way away from immigration but I'm going to let you finish this topic,-0.0927396791234
413,WALLACE, You got about 45 seconds,0.115808256701
414,TRUMP, And she always will be,0.540760320877
415,CLINTON, I -- I find it ironic that he's raising nuclear weapons,-0.321559737465
416,CLINTON, This is a person who has been very cavalier even casual about the use of nuclear weapons,-0.366387952168
417,CLINTON, He's,-0.275239679123
418,TRUMP, Wrong,-2.23523967912
419,TRUMP, CLINTON ,0.304760320877
420,TRUMP, advocated more countries getting them Japan Korea even Saudi Arabia,0.104284288789
421,TRUMP, He said well if we have them why don't we use them which I think is terrifying,0.0656567725897
422,TRUMP,But here's the deal,-0.210239679123
423,TRUMP, The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order it must be followed,-0.417461901346
424,TRUMP, There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible for launching nuclear weapons to do so,-0.274477695167
425,TRUMP, And that's why 10 people who have had that awesome responsibility have come out and in an unprecedented way said they would not trust Donald Trump with the nuclear codes or to have his finger on the nuclear button,-0.0643238063703
426,TRUMP, I have 200 generals,0.247380160438
427,WALLACE, Very quickly,0.594760320877
428,TRUMP, and admirals 21 endorsing me 21 congressional Medal of Honor recipients,0.278960175024
429,TRUMP, As far as Japan and other countries we are being ripped off by everybody in the -- we're defending other countries,-0.100704456308
430,TRUMP, We are spending a fortune doing it,0.316188892305
431,TRUMP, They have the bargain of the century,-0.0187768678201
432,TRUMP,All I said is we have to renegotiate these agreements because our country cannot afford to defend Saudi Arabia Japan Germany South Korea and many other places,0.151991420103
433,TRUMP, We cannot continue to afford -- she took that as saying nuclear weapons,-0.424836626883
434,WALLACE, OK,0.564760320877
435,TRUMP, Look she's been proven to be a liar on so many different ways,-0.16791354996
436,TRUMP, This is just another lie,-0.615239679123
437,CLINTON, Well I'm just quoting you when you were asked,0.315342507446
438,TRUMP, There's no quote,-0.648573012457
439,TRUMP, You're not going to find a quote from me,-0.0396841235679
440,CLINTON, about a potential nuclear -- nuclear competition in Asia you said you know go ahead enjoy yourselves folks,0.237564729668
441,CLINTON, That kind,0.714760320877
442,TRUMP, And defend yourselves,-0.103493119416
443,CLINTON, of language -- well,0.518570240657
444,TRUMP, And defend yourselves,-0.103493119416
445,TRUMP, I didn't say nuclear,-0.690239679123
446,TRUMP, And defend yourself,0.184760320877
447,CLINTON, The United States has kept the peace -- the United States has kept the peace through our alliances,0.505342507446
448,CLINTON, Donald wants to tear up our alliances,-0.155919724963
449,CLINTON, I think it makes the world safer and frankly it makes the United States safer,0.229141590035
450,CLINTON, I would work with our allies in Asia in Europe in the Middle East and elsewhere,0.261010320877
451,CLINTON, That's the only way we're going to be able to keep the peace,0.1816833978
452,WALLACE, We're going to -- no we are going to move on to the next topic which is the economy,-0.19338495917
453,WALLACE, And I hope we handle that as well as we did immigration,0.429760320877
454,WALLACE, You also have very different ideas about how to get the economy growing faster,0.277617463734
455,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton in your plan government plays a big role,0.308760320877
456,WALLACE, You see more government spending more entitlements more tax credits more tax penalties,-0.240221242268
457,WALLACE, Mister Trump you want to get government out with lower taxes and less regulation,-0.420953964838
458,TRUMP, Yes,1.36476032088
459,WALLACE, We're going to drill down into this a little bit more,-0.315672435567
460,WALLACE, But in this overview please explain to me why you believe that your plan will create more jobs and growth for this country and your opponent's plan will not,0.284596171881
461,WALLACE, In this round you go first Secretary Clinton,0.349760320877
462,CLINTON, Well I think when the middle class thrives America thrives,0.335808256701
463,CLINTON, And so my plan is based on growing the economy giving middle-class families many more opportunities,0.493212800822
464,CLINTON, I want us to have the biggest jobs program since World War II jobs in infrastructure and advanced manufacturing,0.145562409252
465,CLINTON, I think we can compete with high-wage countries and I believe we should,0.47208645004
466,CLINTON, New jobs and clean energy not only to fight climate change which is a serious problem but to create new opportunities and new businesses,0.0855936542099
467,CLINTON,I want us to do more to help small business,0.262760320877
468,CLINTON, That's where two- thirds of the new jobs are going to come from,0.0609510407417
469,CLINTON, I want us to raise the national minimum wage because people who live in poverty should not -- who work full-time should not still be in poverty,-0.218555258448
470,CLINTON, And I sure do want to make sure women get equal pay for the work we do,0.401230909112
471,CLINTON,I feel strongly that we have to have an education system that starts with preschool and goes through college,0.30661504083
472,CLINTON, That's why I want more technical education in high schools and in community colleges real apprenticeships to prepare young people for the jobs of the future,0.425346462381
473,CLINTON, I want to make college debt-free and for families making less than $125000 you will not get a tuition bill from a public college or university if the plan that I worked on with Bernie Sanders is enacted,0.0993971207612
474,CLINTON,And we're going to work hard to make sure that it is because we are going to go where the money is,-0.0179669518507
475,CLINTON, Most of the gains in the last years since the Great Recession have gone to the very top,-0.090795234679
476,CLINTON, So we are going to have the wealthy pay their fair share,0.38809365421
477,CLINTON, We're going to have corporations make a contribution greater than they are now to our country,0.207260320877
478,CLINTON,That is a plan that has been analyzed by independent experts which said that it could produce 10 million new jobs,0.249068861745
479,CLINTON, By contrast Donald's plan has been analyzed to conclude it might lose 3,-0.285568983941
480,CLINTON,5 million jobs,0.983173547251
481,CLINTON, Why,-0.395239679123
482,CLINTON, Because his whole plan is to cut taxes to give the biggest tax breaks ever to the wealthy and to corporations adding $20 trillion to our debt and causing the kind of dislocation that we have seen before because it truly will be trickle-down economics on steroids,-0.137873755812
483,CLINTON,So the plan I have I think will actually produce greater opportunities,0.606426987543
484,CLINTON, The plan he has will cost us jobs and possibly lead to another Great Recession,0.107426987543
485,WALLACE, Secretary thank you,0.97809365421
486,WALLACE, Mister Trump why will your plan create more jobs and growth than Secretary Clinton's,0.346188892305
487,TRUMP, Well first of all before I start on my plan her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes,0.149305775422
488,TRUMP, Her tax plan is a disaster,-0.838573012457
489,TRUMP, And she can say all she wants about college tuition,0.406284288789
490,TRUMP, And I'm a big proponent,0.183808256701
491,TRUMP, We're going to do a lot of things for college tuition,0.162509382615
492,TRUMP, But the rest of the public's going to be paying for it,-0.123969705863
493,TRUMP, We will have a massive massive tax increase under Hillary Clinton's plan,0.0147603208766
494,TRUMP, But I'd like to start off where we left because when I said Japan and Germany and I'm -- not to single them out but South Korea these are very rich powerful countries,0.0537069778197
495,TRUMP, Saudi Arabia nothing but money,-0.291239679123
496,TRUMP, We protect Saudi Arabia,0.414760320877
497,TRUMP, Why aren't they paying,-0.445239679123
498,TRUMP,She immediately -- when she heard this I questioned it and I questioned NATO,-0.0712939877575
499,TRUMP, Why aren't the NATO questioned -- why aren't they paying,-0.541715711211
500,TRUMP, Because they weren't paying,-0.465239679123
501,TRUMP,Since I did this -- this was a year ago -- all of a sudden they're paying,-0.154623246285
502,TRUMP, And I've been given a lot -- a lot of credit for it,0.0120864500399
503,TRUMP, All of a sudden they're starting to pay up,0.0647603208766
504,TRUMP, They have to pay up,0.196760320877
505,TRUMP, We're protecting people they have to pay up,0.352260320877
506,TRUMP, And I'm a big fan of NATO,0.187617463734
507,TRUMP, But they have to pay up,-0.0252396791234
508,TRUMP,She comes out and said we love our allies we think our allies are great,0.795426987543
509,TRUMP, Well it's awfully hard to get them to pay up when you have somebody saying we think how great they are,0.201676496073
510,TRUMP,We have to tell Japan in a very nice way we have to tell Germany all of these countries South Korea we have to say you have to help us out,0.327340966038
511,TRUMP, We have during his regime during President Obama's regime we've doubled our national debt,-0.0555797020432
512,TRUMP, We're up to $20 trillion,0.098856192526
513,TRUMP,So my plan -- we're going to renegotiate trade deals,0.295808256701
514,TRUMP, We're going to have a lot of free trade,0.382538098654
515,TRUMP, We're going to have free trade more free trade than we have right now,0.740474606591
516,TRUMP, But we have horrible deals,-0.339239679123
517,TRUMP, Our jobs are being taken out by the deal that her husband signed NAFTA one of the worst deals ever,-0.0544776951672
518,TRUMP, Our jobs are being sucked out of our economy,-0.164128568012
519,TRUMP,You look at all of the places that I just left you go to Pennsylvania you go to Ohio you go to Florida you go to any of them,0.138553424325
520,TRUMP, You go upstate New York,0.543808256701
521,TRUMP, Our jobs have fled to Mexico and other places,0.115871431988
522,TRUMP, We're bringing our jobs back,0.448760320877
523,TRUMP,I am going to renegotiate NAFTA,0.0331735472511
524,TRUMP, And if I can't make a great deal -- then we're going to terminate NAFTA and we're going to create new deals,0.228656640757
525,TRUMP, We're going to have trade but we're going -- we're going to terminate it we're going to make a great trade deal,0.181600291706
526,TRUMP,And if we can't we're going to do it -- we're going to go a separate way because it has been a disaster,-0.357185780031
527,TRUMP, We are going to cut taxes massively,-0.59877686782
528,TRUMP, We're going to cut business taxes massively,-0.613062582106
529,TRUMP, They're going to start hiring people,0.34809365421
530,TRUMP, We're going to bring the $2,-0.116033065936
531,TRUMP,5 trillion,0.0
532,WALLACE, Time Mister Trump,0.11809365421
533,TRUMP, that's offshore back into the country,-0.0193663992695
534,TRUMP, We are going to start the engine rolling again because,0.108760320877
535,WALLACE, Mister Trump,-0.00523967912342
536,TRUMP, right now our country is dying at 1 percent GDP,-0.0681917432987
537,CLINTON, Well let me translate that if I can Chris because,0.162284288789
538,TRUMP, You can't,-0.545239679123
539,CLINTON, the fact is he's going to advocate for the largest tax cuts we've ever seen three times more than the tax cuts under the Bush administration,-0.403701217585
540,CLINTON, I have said repeatedly throughout this campaign I will not raise taxes on anyone making $250000 or less,-0.137726363617
541,CLINTON,I also will not add a penny to the debt,-0.231239679123
542,CLINTON, I have costed out what I'm going to do,0.00645361855696
543,CLINTON, He will through his massive tax cuts add $20 trillion to the debt,-0.454433574643
544,CLINTON,Well he mentioned the debt,-0.295239679123
545,CLINTON, We know how to get control of the debt,-0.235239679123
546,CLINTON, When my husband was president we went from a $300 billion deficit to a $200 billion surplus and we were actually on the path to eliminating the national debt,0.0621989083721
547,CLINTON, When President Obama came into office he inherited the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression,-0.524287199178
548,CLINTON, He has cut the deficit by two-thirds,-0.741634010677
549,CLINTON,So yes one of the ways you go after the debt one of the ways you create jobs is by investing in people,0.0647603208766
550,CLINTON, So I do have investments investments in new jobs investments in education skill training and the opportunities for people to get ahead and stay ahead,0.508360320877
551,CLINTON, That's the kind of approach that will work,0.197260320877
552,WALLACE, Secretary,0.0447603208766
553,CLINTON, Cutting taxes on the wealthy we've tried that,-0.312739679123
554,CLINTON, It has not worked the way that it has been promised,-0.231603315487
555,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton I want to pursue your plan because in many ways it is similar to the Obama stimulus plan in 2009 which has led to the slowest GDP growth since 1949,0.094165280767
556,TRUMP, Correct,1.64476032088
557,WALLACE, Thank you sir,0.924760320877
558,WALLACE,You told me in July when we spoke that the problem is that President Obama didn't get to do enough in what he was trying to do with his stimulus,9.36542099175e-05
559,WALLACE, So is your plan basically more -- even more of the Obama stimulus,0.204394142348
560,CLINTON, Well it's a combination Chris,0.256760320877
561,CLINTON, And let me say that when you inherit the level of economic catastrophe that President Obama inherited it was a real touch-and-go situation,0.0430628737676
562,CLINTON, I was in the Senate before I became secretary of state,-0.104330588214
563,CLINTON, I've never seen people as physically distraught as the Bush administration team was because of what was happening to the economy,-0.298550185874
564,CLINTON,I personally believe that the steps that President Obama took saved the economy,0.129375705492
565,CLINTON, He doesn't get the credit he deserves for taking some very hard positions,-0.113701217585
566,CLINTON, But it was a terrible recession,-1.30523967912
567,CLINTON,So now we've dug ourselves out of it we're standing but we're not yet running,-0.243239679123
568,CLINTON, So what I am proposing is that we invest from the middle out and the ground up not the top down,-0.105942551546
569,CLINTON, That is not going to work,-0.438573012457
570,CLINTON,That's why what I have put forward doesn't add a penny to the debt but it is the kind of approach that will enable more people to take those new jobs higher-paying jobs,0.0421918263046
571,CLINTON, We're beginning to see some increase in incomes and we certainly have had a long string of increasing jobs,0.219246619778
572,CLINTON, We've got to do more to get the whole economy moving and that's what I believe I will be able to do,0.194760320877
573,WALLACE, Mister Trump even conservative economists who have looked at your plan say that the numbers don't add up that your idea and you've talked about 25 million jobs created 4 percent,0.136711267917
574,TRUMP, Over a 10-year period,-0.336429759343
575,WALLACE, growth is unrealistic,0.343173547251
576,WALLACE, And they say -- you talk a lot about growing the energy industry,0.342855680809
577,WALLACE, They say with oil prices as low as they are right now that's unrealistic as well,0.000712800821798
578,WALLACE, Your response sir,0.13809365421
579,TRUMP, So I just left some high representatives of India,0.146982543099
580,TRUMP, They're growing at 8 percent,0.119808256701
581,TRUMP, China is growing at 7 percent,0.0773002673972
582,TRUMP, And that for them is a catastrophically low number,-0.369101936999
583,TRUMP,We are growing -- our last report came out -- and it's right around the 1 percent level,0.0128558229527
584,TRUMP, And I think it's going down,-0.158573012457
585,TRUMP, Last week as you know the end of last week they came out with an anemic jobs report,-0.255504141394
586,TRUMP, A terrible jobs report,-0.585239679123
587,TRUMP, In fact I said is that the last jobs report before the election,-0.153701217585
588,TRUMP, Because if it is I should win easily it was so bad,-0.0835730124567
589,TRUMP, The report was so bad,-0.963239679123
590,TRUMP,Look our country is stagnant,0.315808256701
591,TRUMP, We've lost our jobs,-0.180239679123
592,TRUMP, We've lost our businesses,-0.350239679123
593,TRUMP, We're not making things anymore relatively speaking,-0.0323825362663
594,TRUMP, Our product is pouring in from China pouring in from Vietnam pouring in from all over the world,0.0136492097655
595,TRUMP,I've visited so many communities,0.376760320877
596,TRUMP, This has been such an incredible education for me Chris,0.284760320877
597,TRUMP, I've gotten to know so many -- I've developed so many friends over the last year,0.126962800822
598,TRUMP, And they cry when they see what's happened,-0.482739679123
599,TRUMP, I pass factories that were thriving 20 25 years ago and because of the bill that her husband signed and she blessed 100 percent it is just horrible what's happened to these people in these communities,-0.0720119459118
600,TRUMP,Now she can say that her husband did well but boy did they suffer as NAFTA kicked in because it didn't really kick in very much but it kicked in after they left,-0.219020294908
601,TRUMP, Boy did they suffer,-0.495239679123
602,TRUMP, That was one of the worst things that's ever been signed by our country,-0.266668250552
603,TRUMP,Now she wants to sign Trans-Pacific Partnership,0.324080275037
604,TRUMP, And she wants it,0.0747603208766
605,TRUMP, She lied when she said she didn't call it the gold standard in one of the debates,-0.0696373450573
606,TRUMP, She totally lied,-0.368573012457
607,TRUMP, She did call it the gold standard,0.347617463734
608,TRUMP, And they actually fact checked and they said I was right,0.139305775422
609,TRUMP, I was so honored,0.309760320877
610,WALLACE, I want you to give you a chance to briefly speak to that and then I want to pivot to one-sixth of the economy,0.0618636274702
611,TRUMP, And that will be as bad as NAFTA,-0.335834719233
612,WALLACE, which is Obamacare,-0.210159786082
613,WALLACE, But go ahead briefly,-0.110239679123
614,CLINTON, Well first let me say number one when I saw the final agreement for TPP I said I was against it,0.109295543692
615,CLINTON, It didn't meet my test,-0.251239679123
616,CLINTON, I've had the same test,-0.431239679123
617,CLINTON, Does it create jobs raise incomes and further our national security,0.473418473524
618,CLINTON, I'm against it now,-0.360239679123
619,CLINTON, I'll be against it after the election,-0.415239679123
620,CLINTON, I'll be against it when I'm president,-0.226668250552
621,CLINTON,There's only one of us on this stage who's actually shipped jobs to Mexico because that's Donald,0.0174214784721
622,CLINTON, He's shipped jobs to 12 countries including Mexico,0.203570240657
623,CLINTON,But he mentioned China,-0.255239679123
624,CLINTON, And you know one of the biggest problems we have with China is the illegal dumping of steel and aluminum into our markets,-0.0991318809388
625,CLINTON, I have fought against that as a senator,-0.597739679123
626,CLINTON, I've stood up against it as secretary of state,-0.270795234679
627,CLINTON,Donald has bought Chinese steel and aluminum,0.0926517036085
628,CLINTON, In fact the Trump Hotel right here in Las Vegas was made with Chinese steel,0.21009365421
629,CLINTON, So he goes around with crocodile tears about how terrible it is but he has given jobs to Chinese steelworkers not American steelworkers,-0.301947547064
630,WALLACE, Mister Trump,-0.00523967912342
631,CLINTON, That's the kind of approach that is just not going to work,-0.0619063457901
632,TRUMP, Well let me just say -- let me just say,0.482284288789
633,CLINTON, We're going to pull the country together,0.153331749448
634,CLINTON, We're going to have trade agreements that we enforce,0.268675840779
635,CLINTON, That's why I'm going to have a trade prosecutor for the first time in history,0.0780936542099
636,CLINTON, And we're going to enforce those agreements and we're going to look for businesses to help us by buying American products,0.165486019882
637,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton,0.174760320877
638,WALLACE, Go ahead Mister Trump,0.214760320877
639,TRUMP, Let me ask a simple question,0.191426987543
640,TRUMP, She's been doing this for 30 years,-0.0902054392486
641,TRUMP, Why the hell didn't you do it over the last 15 20 years,-0.546741266951
642,CLINTON, No I voted,-0.20190634579
643,TRUMP, You were very much involved -- excuse me,0.289165280767
644,TRUMP, My turn,0.304760320877
645,TRUMP, You were very much involved in every aspect of this country,0.248396684513
646,TRUMP, Very much,0.554760320877
647,TRUMP, And you do have experience,0.500760320877
648,TRUMP, I say the one thing you have over me is experience but it's bad experience because what you've done has turned out badly,-0.167413592167
649,TRUMP,For 30 years you've been in a position to help and if you say that I use steel or I use something else I -- make it impossible for me to do that,-0.0470433349341
650,TRUMP, I wouldn't mind,-0.128573012457
651,TRUMP,The problem is you talk but you don't get anything done Hillary,-0.163573012457
652,TRUMP, You don't,-0.405239679123
653,TRUMP, Just like when you ran the State Department $6 billion was missing,0.101030294137
654,TRUMP, How do you miss $6 billion,0.167300267397
655,TRUMP, You ran the State Department $6 billion was either stolen,-0.135715711211
656,TRUMP, They don't know,-0.235239679123
657,TRUMP, It's gone $6 billion,-0.0664297593426
658,TRUMP, If you become president this country is going to be in some mess,-0.0275473714311
659,TRUMP, Believe me,1.26476032088
660,CLINTON, Well first of all what he just said about the State Department is not only untrue it's been debunked numerous times,-0.0835615991652
661,CLINTON, But I think it's really an important issue,-0.0352396791234
662,CLINTON, He raised the 30 years of experience so let me just talk briefly about that,0.161776299485
663,CLINTON, You know back in the 1970s I worked for the Children's Defense Fund,0.315529551646
664,CLINTON, And I was taking on discrimination against African-American kids in schools,-0.186581526476
665,CLINTON, He was getting sued by the Justice Department for racial discrimination in his apartment buildings,-0.218223700515
666,CLINTON,In the 1980s I was working to reform the schools in Arkansas,0.0630936542099
667,CLINTON, He was borrowing $14 million from his father to start his businesses,0.31063360073
668,CLINTON, In the 1990s I went to Beijing and I said women's rights are human rights,0.231109632818
669,CLINTON, He insulted a former Miss Universe Alicia Machado called her an eating machine,0.0778741176648
670,TRUMP, Give me a break,0.474760320877
671,CLINTON, And on the day when I was in the Situation Room monitoring the raid that brought Osama bin Laden to justice he was hosting the "Celebrity Apprentice,-0.0487138126191
672,CLINTON," So I'm happy to compare my 30 years of experience what I've done for this country trying to help in every way I could especially kids and families get ahead and stay ahead with your 30 years and I'll let the American people make that decision,0.327435194012
673,TRUMP, Well I think I did a much better job,0.651426987543
674,TRUMP, I built a massive company a great company some of the greatest assets anywhere in the world worth many many billions of dollars,0.449770741708
675,TRUMP, I started with a $1 million loan,0.318365989323
676,TRUMP, I agree with that,0.444760320877
677,TRUMP, It's a $1 million loan,0.0438082567013
678,TRUMP, But I built a phenomenal company,0.0339669340638
679,TRUMP,And if we could run our country the way I've run my company we would have a country that you would be so proud of,0.271960320877
680,TRUMP, You would even be proud of it,0.361903178019
681,TRUMP,And frankly when you look at her real record take a look at Syria,0.115508846466
682,TRUMP, Take a look at the migration,-0.118573012457
683,TRUMP, Take a look at Libya,-0.128191743299
684,TRUMP, Take a look at Iraq,-0.423239679123
685,TRUMP, She gave us ISIS because her and Obama created this huge vacuum and a small group came out of that huge vacuum because when -- we should never have been in Iraq but once we were there we should have never got out the way they wanted to get out,-0.0840205047935
686,TRUMP, She gave us ISIS as sure as you are sitting there,0.353418473524
687,TRUMP, And what happened is now ISIS is in 32 countries,-0.0521917432987
688,TRUMP, And now I listen how she's going to get rid of ISIS,-0.0489697058631
689,TRUMP, She's going to get rid of nobody,-0.443811107695
690,WALLACE, All right,1.00476032088
691,WALLACE, We are going to get to foreign hot spots in a few moments but the next segment is fitness to be president of the United States,0.0616833977997
692,WALLACE, Mister Trump at the last debate you said your talk about grabbing women was just that talk and that you'd never actually done it,-0.0704380258266
693,WALLACE, And since then as we all know nine women have come forward and have said that you either groped them or kissed them without their consent,0.216115693151
694,WALLACE,Why would so many different women from so many different circumstances over so many different years why would they all in this last couple of weeks make up -- you deny this -- why would they all make up these stories,0.0869671344924
695,WALLACE,Since this is a question for both of you Secretary Clinton Mister Trump says what your husband did and that you defended was even worse,-0.0840396791234
696,WALLACE, Mister Trump you go first,0.492760320877
697,TRUMP, Well first of all those stories have been largely debunked,0.466284288789
698,TRUMP, Those people -- I don't know those people,0.036665280767
699,TRUMP, I have a feeling how they came,0.110474606591
700,TRUMP, I believe it was her campaign that did it,0.0647603208766
701,TRUMP,Just like if you look at what came out today on the clips where I was wondering what happened with my rally in Chicago and other rallies where we had such violence,-0.0510134391508
702,TRUMP, She's the one and Obama that caused the violence,-0.555239679123
703,TRUMP, They hired people -- they paid them $1500 and they're on tape saying be violent cause fights do bad things,-0.177715711211
704,TRUMP,I would say the only way -- because those stories are all totally false I have to say that,-0.0228586433801
705,TRUMP, And I didn't even apologize to my wife who's sitting right here because I didn't do anything,0.0494662032295
706,TRUMP, I didn't know any of these -- I didn't see these women,0.0293636274702
707,TRUMP,These women -- the woman on the plane the -- I think they want either fame or her campaign did it,0.263354576031
708,TRUMP, And I think it's her campaign,0.191426987543
709,TRUMP, Because what I saw what they did which is a criminal act by the way where they're telling people to go out and start fist-fights and start violence,-0.284695404869
710,TRUMP,And I'll tell you what in particular in Chicago people were hurt and people could have been killed in that riot,-0.360001583885
711,TRUMP, And that was now all on tape started by her,0.0707603208766
712,TRUMP, I believe Chris that she got these people to step forward,0.28112395724
713,TRUMP, If it wasn't they get their 10 minutes of fame,-0.0997157112111
714,TRUMP, But they were all totally -- it was all fiction,0.0582842887889
715,TRUMP, It was lies and it was fiction,-0.626668250552
716,CLINTON, Well,1.30476032088
717,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton,0.174760320877
718,CLINTON, At the last debate we heard Donald talking about what he did to women,0.00333174944801
719,CLINTON, And after that a number of women have come forward saying that's exactly what he did to them,0.0780936542099
720,CLINTON, Now what was his response,-0.0672396791234
721,CLINTON, Well he held a number of big rallies where he said that he could not possibly have done those things to those women because they were not attractive enough for them to be assaulted,0.046833243178
722,TRUMP, I did not say that,-0.207239679123
723,TRUMP, I did not say that,-0.207239679123
724,CLINTON, In fact he went on to say,0.0219031780194
725,CLINTON, WALLACE Her two minutes -- sir her two minutes,0.00867584077919
726,CLINTON, Her two minutes,0.131426987543
727,TRUMP, I did not say that,-0.207239679123
728,WALLACE, It's her two minutes,-0.0252396791234
729,CLINTON, He went on to say "Look at her,-0.063334719233
730,CLINTON, I don't think so,-0.150239679123
731,CLINTON," About another woman he said "That wouldn't be my first choice,0.243966934064
732,CLINTON," He attacked the woman reporter writing the story called her "disgusting" as he has called a number of women during this campaign,0.0347811625395
733,CLINTON,Donald thinks belittling women makes him bigger,0.60122313218
734,CLINTON, He goes after their dignity their self-worth and I don't think there is a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like,0.0315098721428
735,CLINTON, So we now know what Donald thinks and what he says and how he acts toward women,0.205936791465
736,CLINTON, That's who Donald is,-0.125239679123
737,CLINTON,I think it's really up to all of us to demonstrate who we are and who our country is and to stand up and be very clear about what we expect from our next president how we want to bring our country together where we don't want to have the kind of pitting of people one against the other where instead we celebrate our diversity we lift people up and we make our country even greater,0.278381895602
738,CLINTON,America is great because America is good,0.904760320877
739,CLINTON, And it really is up to all of us to make that true now and in the future and particularly for our children and our grandchildren,0.354760320877
740,WALLACE, Mister Trump,-0.00523967912342
741,TRUMP, Nobody has more respect for women than I do,0.309204765321
742,TRUMP, Nobody,-1.73523967912
743,TRUMP,LAUGHTER,3.12476032088
744,TRUMP,Nobody has more respect,0.224760320877
745,WALLACE, Please everybody,0.904760320877
746,TRUMP, And frankly those stories have been largely debunked,0.168570240657
747,TRUMP, And I really want to just talk about something slightly different,0.0629421390584
748,TRUMP,She mentions this which is all fiction all fictionalized probably or possibly started by her and her very sleazy campaign,0.216046272745
749,TRUMP, But I will tell you what isn't fictionalized are her e-mails where she destroyed 33000 e-mails criminally criminally after getting a subpoena from the United States Congress,-0.100177540091
750,TRUMP,What happened to the FBI I don't know,-0.397739679123
751,TRUMP, We have a great general four-star general today you read it in all of the papers going to potentially serve five years in jail for lying to the FBI,-0.0678176212226
752,TRUMP, One lie,-1.37523967912
753,TRUMP, She's lied hundreds of times to the people to Congress and to the FBI,-0.392382536266
754,TRUMP, He's going to probably go to jail,-0.600953964838
755,TRUMP, This is a four-star general,-0.140191743299
756,TRUMP, And she gets away with it and she can run for the presidency of the United States,0.115348556171
757,TRUMP, That's really what you should be talking about not fiction where somebody wants fame or where they come out of her crooked campaign,-0.0361092443408
758,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton,0.174760320877
759,CLINTON, Well every time Donald is pushed on something which is obviously uncomfortable like what these women are saying he immediately goes to denying responsibility,0.0495619741734
760,CLINTON, And it's not just about women,-0.0419063457901
761,CLINTON, He never apologizes or says he's sorry for anything,-0.517990825887
762,CLINTON,So we know what he has said and what he's done to women,0.17091416703
763,CLINTON, But he also went after a disabled reporter mocked and mimicked him on national television,-0.177207721907
764,TRUMP, Wrong,-2.23523967912
765,CLINTON, He went after Mister and Mister,-0.128573012457
766,CLINTON, Khan the parents of a young man who died serving our country a Gold Star family because of their religion,0.328522304833
767,CLINTON, He went after John McCain a prisoner of war said he prefers "people who aren't captured,-0.784584719233
768,CLINTON," He went after a federal judge born in Indiana but who Donald said couldn't be trusted to try the fraud and racketeering case against Trump University because his parents were Mexican,-0.142412199178
769,CLINTON,So it's not one thing,-0.415239679123
770,CLINTON, This is a pattern a pattern of divisiveness of a very dark and in many ways dangerous vision of our country where he incites violence where he applauds people who are pushing and pulling and punching at his rallies,-0.24456792539
771,CLINTON, That is not who America is,-0.21190634579
772,CLINTON,And I hope that as we move in the last weeks of this campaign more and more people will understand what's at stake in this election,0.0978372439535
773,CLINTON, It really does come down to what kind of country we are going to have,0.0620936542099
774,TRUMP, So sad when she talks about violence at my rallies and she caused the violence,-0.664890367182
775,TRUMP, It's on tape,-0.16190634579
776,WALLACE, During the last,-0.735239679123
777,TRUMP, The other things are false but honestly I'd love to talk about getting rid of ISIS and I'd love to talk about other things,0.10872864084
778,WALLACE, OK,0.564760320877
779,TRUMP, but those other charges as she knows are false,-0.484128568012
780,WALLACE, In this bucket about fitness to be president there's been a lot of developments over the last 10 days since the last debate,-0.134577084379
781,WALLACE, I'd like to ask you about them,0.219046035162
782,WALLACE, These are questions that the American people have,0.112260320877
783,WALLACE,Secretary Clinton during your 2009 Senate confirmation hearing you promised to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest with your dealing with the Clinton Foundation while you were secretary of state but e-mails show that donors got special access to you,0.0196663375392
784,WALLACE, Those seeking grants for Haiti relief were considered separately from non-donors and some of those donors got contracts government contracts taxpayer money,0.00547482257523
785,WALLACE,Can you really say that you kept your pledge to that Senate committee,0.0767018346553
786,WALLACE, And why isn't what happened and what went on between you and the Clinton Foundation why isn't it what Mister Trump calls pay to play,-0.144039679123
787,CLINTON, Well everything I did as secretary of state was in furtherance of our country's interests and our values,0.280051414161
788,CLINTON, The State Department has said that,-0.205239679123
789,CLINTON, I think that's been proven,0.187808256701
790,CLINTON,But I am happy in fact I'm thrilled to talk about the Clinton Foundation because it is a world-renowned charity and I am so proud of the work that it does,0.119937074368
791,CLINTON, You know I could talk for the rest of the debate -- I know I don't have the time to do that,0.1390893972
792,CLINTON,But just briefly the Clinton Foundation made it possible for 11 million people around the world with HIV-AIDS to afford treatment and that's about half all the people in the world who are getting treatment,0.0987740168265
793,CLINTON, In partnership with the American Health Association,0.659046035162
794,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton,0.174760320877
795,CLINTON, we have made environments in schools healthier for kids including healthier lunches,0.433173547251
796,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton respectfully this is -- this is an open discussion,-0.0142870101919
797,CLINTON, Well it is an open discussion,0.211426987543
798,CLINTON, And you,0.354760320877
799,WALLACE, And the specific question went to pay for play,0.00476032087658
800,WALLACE, Do you want to talk about that,0.173331749448
801,CLINTON, Well but there is no -- but there is no evidence -- but there is,-0.469207721907
802,TRUMP, I think that it's been very well,0.307617463734
803,WALLACE, Let's ask Mister Trump,-0.0252396791234
804,CLINTON, There is a lot of evidence about the very good work,0.132033048149
805,TRUMP, It's been very well studied,0.392760320877
806,CLINTON, and the high rankings,0.259760320877
807,WALLACE, Please let me Mister Trump speak,0.451426987543
808,TRUMP, and it's a criminal enterprise and so many people know it,-0.197057860942
809,WALLACE, Please let Mister Trump speak,0.300760320877
810,TRUMP, It's a criminal enterprise,-0.790239679123
811,TRUMP, Saudi Arabia giving $25 million Qatar all of these countries,0.327808256701
812,TRUMP, You talk about women and women's rights,0.710474606591
813,TRUMP, So these are people that push gays off business -- off buildings,-0.272699732603
814,TRUMP, These are people that kill women and treat women horribly,0.0742842887889
815,TRUMP, And yet you take their money,0.25809365421
816,TRUMP,So I'd like to ask you right now why don't you give back the money that you've taken from certain countries that treat certain groups of people so horribly,0.198389275329
817,TRUMP, Why don't you give back the money,0.184760320877
818,TRUMP, I think it would be a great gesture,0.461665280767
819,TRUMP,Because she takes a tremendous amount of money,0.407260320877
820,TRUMP, And you take a look at the people of Haiti,-0.129239679123
821,TRUMP, I was at a little Haiti the other day in Florida,-0.122512406396
822,TRUMP, And I want to tell you they hate the Clintons because what's happened in Haiti with the Clinton Foundation is a disgrace,-0.313637875527
823,TRUMP, And you know it and they know it and everybody knows it,0.216426987543
824,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton,0.174760320877
825,CLINTON, Well very quickly we at the Clinton Foundation spend 90 percent -- 90 percent of all the money that is donated on behalf of programs of people around the world and in our own country,0.27520943623
826,CLINTON, I'm very proud of that,0.436760320877
827,CLINTON, We have the highest rating from the watchdogs that follow foundations,0.249782109888
828,CLINTON, And I'd be happy to compare what we do with the Trump Foundation which took money from other people and bought a six- foot portrait of Donald,0.214213642326
829,CLINTON, I mean who does that,-0.411239679123
830,CLINTON, It just was astonishing,-0.186429759343
831,CLINTON,But when it comes to Haiti Haiti is the poorest country in our hemisphere,-0.255919724963
832,CLINTON, The earthquake and the hurricanes it has devastated Haiti,-0.698519750429
833,CLINTON, Bill and I have been involved in trying to help Haiti for many years,-0.076668250552
834,CLINTON, The Clinton Foundation raised $30 million to help Haiti after the catastrophic earthquake and all of the terrible problems the people there had,-0.323479707026
835,CLINTON,We have done things to help small businesses agriculture and so much else,0.2416833978
836,CLINTON, And we're going to keep working to help Haiti,-0.0796841235679
837,WALLACE, All right,1.00476032088
838,CLINTON, because it's an important part of the American experience,0.0714269875433
839,TRUMP, They don't want you to help them anymore,-0.150239679123
840,TRUMP, I'd like to mention one thing,0.281426987543
841,TRUMP, Trump Foundation small foundation,-0.0902396791234
842,TRUMP, People contribute I contribute,0.894760320877
843,TRUMP, The money goes 100 percent -- 100 percent goes to different charities including a lot of military,0.0389343630233
844,TRUMP, I don't get anything,-0.155239679123
845,TRUMP, I don't buy boats,0.212260320877
846,TRUMP, I don't buy planes,0.0747603208766
847,TRUMP, What happens -- the money goes to them,-0.023334719233
848,WALLACE, Wasn't some of the money used to settle your lawsuits sir,-0.367966951851
849,TRUMP, No it was -- we put up the American flag,0.0262842887889
850,TRUMP, And that's it,-0.20190634579
851,TRUMP, They put up the American flag,0.421426987543
852,TRUMP, We fought for the right in Palm Beach to put up the American flag,0.287617463734
853,WALLACE, Right,1.16476032088
854,WALLACE, But there was a penalty that was imposed by Palm Beach County and the money came from your foundation,-0.182608100176
855,TRUMP, There was,-0.525239679123
856,TRUMP, There was,-0.525239679123
857,TRUMP, And by the way,-0.270239679123
858,WALLACE, instead of Mar-a-Lago or yourself sir,-0.0893663992695
859,TRUMP, the money -- the money went to Fisher House where they build houses -- the money that you're talking about went to Fisher House where they build houses for veterans and disabled vets,0.171600291706
860,WALLACE, I want to get into one,0.11809365421
861,CLINTON, But of course there's no way we can know whether any of that is true because he hasn't released his tax returns,-0.221603315487
862,CLINTON, He is the first candidate ever to run for president in the last 40-plus years who has not released his tax returns so everything he says about charity or anything else we can't prove it,-0.157661402577
863,CLINTON, You can look at our tax returns,-0.163811107695
864,CLINTON, We've got them all out there,-0.0285730124567
865,CLINTON,But what is really troubling is that we learned in the last debate he has not paid a penny in federal income tax,-0.0728379539441
866,CLINTON, And we were talking about immigrants a few minutes ago Chris,-0.0643305882143
867,CLINTON, You know half of all immigrants -- undocumented immigrants in our country -- actually pay federal income tax,0.0973002673972
868,CLINTON, So we have undocumented immigrants in America who are paying more federal income tax than a billionaire,0.0559649890088
869,CLINTON, I find that just astonishing,0.223808256701
870,WALLACE, I want,0.434760320877
871,TRUMP, So let me just tell you very quickly we're entitled because of the laws that people like her passed to take massive amounts of depreciation on other charges and we do it,0.123361560849
872,TRUMP, And all of her donors -- just about all of them -- I know Buffett took hundreds of millions of dollars Soros George Soros took hundreds of millions of dollars,0.260474923368
873,WALLACE, We,1.00476032088
874,TRUMP, Let me just explain,0.419760320877
875,WALLACE, But no we heard this,-0.471239679123
876,TRUMP, Most of her donors have done the same thing as I do,0.25436362747
877,WALLACE, Mister Trump we -- OK,0.311808256701
878,TRUMP, You know what she should have done,0.470474606591
879,WALLACE, Folks we heard this,0.334760320877
880,TRUMP, And you know Hillary what you should have done you should have changed the law when you were a United States senator,0.188396684513
881,WALLACE, Folks we heard this,0.334760320877
882,TRUMP, because your donors and your special interests are doing the same thing as I do except even more so,0.17714135662
883,CLINTON, Well you know,0.964760320877
884,TRUMP, You should have changed the law,-0.00190634579008
885,TRUMP, But you won't change the law because you take in so much money,-0.0167781406619
886,TRUMP, I mean I sat in my apartment today on a very beautiful hotel down the street known as Trump,0.184760320877
887,CLINTON, Made with Chinese steel,0.224760320877
888,TRUMP, But I will tell you I sat there,0.137260320877
889,TRUMP, I sat there watching ad after ad after ad false ad,-0.364330588214
890,TRUMP, All paid for by your friends on Wall Street that gave so much money because they know you're going to protect them,0.375669411786
891,TRUMP, And frankly you should have changed the laws,0.00166528076701
892,WALLACE, Mister Trump,-0.00523967912342
893,TRUMP, If you don't like what I did you should have changed the laws,0.0509141670304
894,WALLACE, Mister Trump I want to ask you about one last question in this topic,-0.086668250552
895,WALLACE, You have been warning at rallies recently that this election is rigged and that Hillary Clinton is in the process of trying to steal it from you,-0.242999702892
896,WALLACE,Your running mate Governor Pence pledged on Sunday that he and you -- his words -- "will absolutely accept the result of this election,0.247101920694
897,WALLACE," Today your daughter Ivanka said the same thing,0.281480249571
898,WALLACE, I want to ask you here on the stage tonight Do you make the same commitment that you will absolutely -- sir that you will absolutely accept the result of this election,0.274611560849
899,TRUMP, I will look at it at the time,0.00226032087658
900,TRUMP, I'm not looking at anything now,-0.0952396791234
901,TRUMP, I'll look at it at the time,-0.166668250552
902,TRUMP,What I've seen -- what I've seen is so bad,-0.391715711211
903,TRUMP, First of all the media is so dishonest and so corrupt and the pile-on is so amazing,0.11803791131
904,TRUMP, The New York Times actually wrote an article about it but they don't even care,-0.0245730124567
905,TRUMP, It's so dishonest,-0.263493119416
906,TRUMP, And they've poisoned the mind of the voters,-0.113334719233
907,TRUMP,But unfortunately for them I think the voters are seeing through it,-0.208573012457
908,TRUMP, I think they're going to see through it,0.194760320877
909,TRUMP, We'll find out on November 8th,0.10809365421
910,TRUMP, But I think they're going to see through it,0.0469825430988
911,WALLACE, But sir there's,-0.46190634579
912,TRUMP, If you look -- excuse me Chris -- if you look at your voter rolls you will see millions of people that are registered to vote -- millions this isn't coming from me -- this is coming from Pew Report and other places -- millions of people that are registered to vote that shouldn't be registered to vote,0.123840971805
913,TRUMP,So let me just give you one other thing,0.35809365421
914,TRUMP, So I talk about the corrupt media,0.0812231321799
915,TRUMP, I talk about the millions of people -- tell you one other thing,0.281317219271
916,TRUMP, She shouldn't be allowed to run,-0.0219063457901
917,TRUMP, It's crooked -- she's -- she's guilty of a very very serious crime,-0.602125882335
918,TRUMP, She should not be allowed to run,-0.0352396791234
919,TRUMP,And just in that respect I say it's rigged because she should never,0.0274710654245
920,WALLACE, But,-1.13523967912
921,TRUMP, Chris she should never have been allowed to run for the presidency based on what she did with e-mails and so many other things,-0.0246046924933
922,WALLACE, But sir there is a tradition in this country -- in fact one of the prides of this country -- is the peaceful transition of power and that no matter how hard-fought a campaign is that at the end of the campaign that the loser concedes to the winner,-0.140623385335
923,WALLACE, Not saying that you're necessarily going to be the loser or the winner but that the loser concedes to the winner and that the country comes together in part for the good of the country,-0.14280425972
924,WALLACE, Are you saying you're not prepared now to commit to that principle,0.0476969608035
925,TRUMP, What I'm saying is that I will tell you at the time,0.0814269875433
926,TRUMP, I'll keep you in suspense,0.295808256701
927,TRUMP, OK,0.564760320877
928,CLINTON, Well Chris let me respond to that because that's horrifying,0.146284288789
929,CLINTON, You know every time Donald thinks things are not going in his direction he claims whatever it is is rigged against him,-0.0663651482542
930,CLINTON,The FBI conducted a year-long investigation into my e-mails,-0.267408639318
931,CLINTON, They concluded there was no case; he said the FBI was rigged,-0.382699732603
932,CLINTON, He lost the Iowa caucus,-0.620191743299
933,CLINTON, He lost the Wisconsin primary,-0.455239679123
934,CLINTON, He said the Republican primary was rigged against him,-0.375768603665
935,CLINTON, Then Trump University gets sued for fraud and racketeering; he claims the court system and the federal judge is rigged against him,-0.35407063197
936,CLINTON, There was even a time when he didn't get an Emmy for his TV program three years in a row and he started tweeting that the Emmys were rigged against him,-0.114410032757
937,TRUMP, Should have gotten it,-0.000239679123416
938,CLINTON, This is -- this is a mindset,-0.165171199374
939,CLINTON, This is how Donald thinks,-0.0192396791234
940,CLINTON, And it's funny but it's also really troubling,0.096665280767
941,WALLACE, OK,0.564760320877
942,CLINTON, So that is not the way our democracy works,-0.128573012457
943,CLINTON, We've been around for 240 years,-0.0160330659362
944,CLINTON, We've had free and fair elections,0.454760320877
945,CLINTON, We've accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them,0.246578502695
946,CLINTON, And that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a debate stage during a general election,-0.147461901346
947,CLINTON, You know President Obama said the other day when you're whining before the game is even finished,0.269186184354
948,WALLACE, Hold on,0.254760320877
949,WALLACE, Hold on folks,0.391426987543
950,WALLACE, Hold on folks,0.391426987543
951,CLINTON, it just shows you're not up to doing the job,-0.0172396791234
952,CLINTON, And let's -- you know let's be clear about what he is saying and what that means,0.0715391255309
953,CLINTON, He is denigrating -- he's talking down our democracy,0.0703691384596
954,CLINTON, And I for one am appalled that somebody who is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind of position,0.0979794952065
955,TRUMP, I think what the FBI did and what the Department of Justice did including meeting with her husband the attorney general in the back of an airplane on the tarmac in Arizona I think it's disgraceful,0.000474738581313
956,TRUMP, I think it's a disgrace,-0.383239679123
957,WALLACE, All right,1.00476032088
958,TRUMP, I think we've never had a situation so bad in this country,-0.323573012457
959,WALLACE, Hold on folks,0.391426987543
960,WALLACE, This doesn't do any good for anyone,-0.0752396791234
961,WALLACE, Let's please continue the debate and let's move on to the subject of foreign hot spots,-0.0514896791234
962,WALLACE,The Iraqi offensive to take back Mosul has begun,-0.52021304811
963,WALLACE, If they are successful in pushing ISIS out of that city and out of all of Iraq the question then becomes what happens the day after,-0.140038153003
964,WALLACE, And that's something that whichever of you ends up -- whoever of you ends up as president is going to have to confront,-0.101947547064
965,WALLACE,Will you put US troops into that vacuum to make sure that ISIS doesn't come back or isn't replaced by something even worse,-0.229566663547
966,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton you go first in this segment,0.339760320877
967,WALLACE, You have two minutes,0.309760320877
968,CLINTON, Well I am encouraged that there is an effort led by the Iraqi army supported by Kurdish forces and also given the help and advice from the number of special forces and other Americans on the ground,0.00625328517722
969,CLINTON, But I will not support putting American soldiers into Iraq as an occupying force,-0.205579702043
970,CLINTON, I don't think that is in our interest and I don't think that would be smart to do,0.132538098654
971,CLINTON, In fact Chris I think that would be a big red flag waving for ISIS to reconstitute itself,0.195898063001
972,CLINTON,The goal here is to take back Mosul,0.046665280767
973,CLINTON, It's going to be a hard fight,-0.660953964838
974,CLINTON, I've got no illusions about that,-0.355239679123
975,CLINTON, And then continue to press into Syria to begin to take back and move on Raqqa which is the ISIS headquarters,-0.0692530582963
976,CLINTON,I am hopeful that the hard work that American military advisers have done will pay off and that we will see a real -- a really successful military operation,0.118914781506
977,CLINTON, But we know we've got lots of work to do,0.138760320877
978,CLINTON, Syria will remain a hotbed of terrorism as long as the civil war aided and abetted by the Iranians and the Russians continue,-0.421491922792
979,CLINTON,So I have said look we need to keep our eye on ISIS,0.236701834655
980,CLINTON, That's why I want to have an intelligence surge that protects us here at home why we have to go after them from the air on the ground online why we have to make sure here at home we don't let terrorists buy weapons,0.147163026271
981,CLINTON, If you're too dangerous to fly you're too dangerous to buy a gun,-0.667547371431
982,CLINTON,And I'm going to continue to push for a no-fly zone and safe havens within Syria not only to help protect the Syrians and prevent the constant outflow of refugees but to frankly gain some leverage on both the Syrian government and the Russians so that perhaps we can have the kind of serious negotiation necessary to bring the conflict to an end and go forward on a political track,-0.15842314895
983,WALLACE, Mister Trump same question,-0.105239679123
984,WALLACE, If we are able to push ISIS out of Mosul and out of Iraq will -- would you be willing to put US troops in there to prevent their return or something else,-0.116278496173
985,TRUMP, Let me tell you Mosul is so sad,-0.170834719233
986,TRUMP, We had Mosul,0.123173547251
987,TRUMP, But when she left when she took everybody out we lost Mosul,-0.27063637253
988,TRUMP, Now we're fighting again to get Mosul,-0.253062582106
989,TRUMP, The problem with Mosul and what they wanted to do is they wanted to get the leaders of ISIS who they felt were in Mosul,-0.160610917629
990,TRUMP,About three months ago I started reading that they want to get the leaders and they're going to attack Mosul,-0.0554776951672
991,TRUMP, Whatever happened to the element of surprise OK,0.0872603208766
992,TRUMP, We announce we're going after Mosul,0.197300267397
993,TRUMP, I have been reading about going after Mosul now for about -- how long is it Hillary three months,-0.0136355023736
994,TRUMP, These people have all left,0.212760320877
995,TRUMP, They've all left,-0.0952396791234
996,TRUMP,The element of surprise,0.419760320877
997,TRUMP, Douglas MacArthur George Patton spinning in their graves when they see the stupidity of our country,-0.0780072392878
998,TRUMP, So we're now fighting for Mosul that we had,-0.275768603665
999,TRUMP, All she had to do was stay there and now we're going in to get it,0.0372603208766
1000,TRUMP,But you know who the big winner in Mosul is going to be after we eventually get it,0.204495858606
1001,TRUMP, And the only reason they did it is because she's running for the office of president and they want to look tough,-0.12887604276
1002,TRUMP, They want to look good,0.432760320877
1003,TRUMP, He violated the red line in the sand and he made so many mistakes made all the mistakes,-0.353017456901
1004,TRUMP, That's why we have the great migration,0.484760320877
1005,TRUMP, But she wanted to look good for the election,0.0247603208766
1006,TRUMP, So they're going in,-0.0402396791234
1007,TRUMP,But who's going to get Mosul really,-0.121634010677
1008,TRUMP, We'll take Mosul eventually,-0.0214297593426
1009,TRUMP, But the way -- if you look at what's happening much tougher than they thought,-0.0718743885736
1010,TRUMP, Much much tougher,0.243173547251
1011,TRUMP, Much more dangerous,-0.568573012457
1012,TRUMP, Going to be more deaths that they thought,-0.262739679123
1013,TRUMP,But the leaders that we wanted to get are all gone because they're smart,-0.016668250552
1014,TRUMP, They say what do we need this for,0.0272603208766
1015,TRUMP, So Mosul is going to be a wonderful thing,0.213120285224
1016,TRUMP, And Iran should write us a letter of thank you just like the really stupid -- the stupidest deal of all time a deal that's going to give Iran absolutely nuclear weapons,0.0019628008218
1017,TRUMP, Iran should write us yet another letter saying thank you very much because Iran as I said many years ago Iran is taking over Iraq something they've wanted to do forever but we've made it so easy for them,-0.0178037816875
1018,TRUMP,So we're now going to take Mosul,-0.0273482963915
1019,TRUMP, And do you know who's going to be the beneficiary,0.100284288789
1020,TRUMP, Iran,-1.07523967912
1021,TRUMP, Oh yeah they're making -- I mean they are outsmarting -- look you're not there you might be involved in that decision,-0.0595251774248
1022,TRUMP, But you were there when you took everybody out of Mosul and out of Iraq,-0.294223700515
1023,TRUMP, You shouldn't have been in Iraq but you did vote for it,-0.17190634579
1024,TRUMP, You shouldn't have been in Iraq but once you were in Iraq you should have never left the way,-0.347871258071
1025,WALLACE, Sir your two minutes are up,0.0980936542099
1026,TRUMP, The point is the big winner is going to be Iran,0.0902148663311
1027,CLINTON, Well you know once again Donald is implying that he didn't support the invasion of Iraq,-0.159287199178
1028,CLINTON, I said it was a mistake,-0.55190634579
1029,CLINTON, I've said that years ago,-0.163239679123
1030,CLINTON, He has consistently denied what is,-0.626033065936
1031,TRUMP, Wrong,-2.23523967912
1032,CLINTON, a very clear fact that,0.324760320877
1033,TRUMP, Wrong,-2.23523967912
1034,CLINTON, before the invasion he supported it,-0.285239679123
1035,CLINTON, And you know I just want everybody to go Google it,0.432033048149
1036,CLINTON, Google "Donald Trump Iraq,0.0685702406574
1037,CLINTON," And you will see the dozens of sources which verify that he was for the invasion of Iraq,-0.2273197129
1038,TRUMP, Wrong,-2.23523967912
1039,CLINTON, And you can actually hear the audio of him saying that,0.0883966845129
1040,CLINTON, Now why does that matter,-0.0872396791234
1041,CLINTON, Well it matters because he has not told the truth about that position,-0.00293198681572
1042,CLINTON, I guess he believes it makes him look better now to contrast with me because I did vote for it,0.280760320877
1043,CLINTON,But what's really important here is to understand all the interplay,0.0770548371605
1044,CLINTON, Mosul is a Sunni city,0.010856192526
1045,CLINTON, Mosul is on the border of Syria,-0.188028342231
1046,CLINTON, And yes we do need to go after Baghdadi and -- just like we went after bin Laden while you were doing "Celebrity Apprentice" and we brought him to justice,0.20463360073
1047,CLINTON, We need to go after the leadership,0.0961888923052
1048,CLINTON,But we need to get rid of them get rid of their fighters,-0.312528934575
1049,CLINTON, There are an estimated several thousand fighters in Mosul,0.0125913606818
1050,CLINTON, They've been digging underground,-0.285239679123
1051,CLINTON, They've been prepared to defend,0.0167603208766
1052,CLINTON, It's going to be tough fighting,-0.76190634579
1053,CLINTON, But I think we can take back Mosul and then we can move on into Syria and take back Raqqa,0.0900462727451
1054,CLINTON,This is what we have to do,0.0504746065909
1055,CLINTON, I'm just amazed that he seems to think that the Iraqi government and our allies and everybody else launched the attack on Mosul to help me in this election but that's how Donald thinks,-0.0265561591492
1056,CLINTON, You know he always is looking for some conspiracy,0.0558714319877
1057,TRUMP, Chris we don't gain anything,0.0327603208766
1058,CLINTON, He has all the conspiracy theories,-0.185239679123
1059,TRUMP, Iran is taking over Iraq,-0.671239679123
1060,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton it's,-0.0485730124567
1061,TRUMP, Iran is taking over Iraq,-0.671239679123
1062,TRUMP, We don't gain anything,0.0797603208766
1063,CLINTON, This conspiracy theory which he's been spewing out for quite some time,-0.363969705863
1064,TRUMP, If they did it by surprise,0.171426987543
1065,WALLACE, Wait wait wait Secretary Clinton it's an open discussion,-0.504128568012
1066,CLINTON, He says,-0.0252396791234
1067,TRUMP, We could have gained if they did it by surprise,0.368760320877
1068,WALLACE, Secretary please let Mister Trump speak,0.25809365421
1069,CLINTON, unfit and he proves it every time he talks,0.0725913606818
1070,TRUMP, No you are the one that's unfit,-0.244491153534
1071,TRUMP, You know WikiLeaks just actually came out -- John Podesta said some horrible things about you and boy was he right,-0.0197292487725
1072,TRUMP, He said some beauties,-0.0764297593426
1073,TRUMP, And you know Bernie Sanders he said you have bad judgment,-0.101126981021
1074,TRUMP, You do,0.624760320877
1075,TRUMP,And if you think that going into Mosul after we let the world know we're going in and all of the people that we really wanted -- the leaders -- they're all gone,0.0885699886757
1076,TRUMP, If you think that was good then you do,0.311426987543
1077,TRUMP, Now John Podesta said you have terrible instincts,-0.123929759343
1078,TRUMP, Bernie Sanders said you have bad judgment,-0.370205439249
1079,TRUMP, I agree with both,0.684760320877
1080,CLINTON, Well you should ask Bernie Sanders who he's supporting for president,0.197054837161
1081,CLINTON, And he has said,-0.0752396791234
1082,TRUMP, Which is a big mistake,-0.503239679123
1083,CLINTON, as he has campaigned for me around the country you are the most dangerous person to run for president in the modern history of America,0.0845699080415
1084,CLINTON, I think he's right,0.564760320877
1085,WALLACE, Let's turn to Aleppo,-0.121429759343
1086,WALLACE, Mister Trump in the last debate you were both asked about the situation in the Syrian city of Aleppo,-0.1473197129
1087,WALLACE, And I want to follow up on that because you said several things in that debate which were not true sir,0.0314269875433
1088,WALLACE, You said that Aleppo has basically fallen,-0.204491153534
1089,WALLACE, In fact there -- in fact there are,0.066665280767
1090,WALLACE, TRUMP It's a catastrophe,-0.176429759343
1091,WALLACE, I mean,-0.575239679123
1092,WALLACE, It's a catastrophe but there,-0.408191743299
1093,TRUMP, it's a mess,-0.688573012457
1094,WALLACE, There are a quarter of,-0.175239679123
1095,TRUMP, Have you seen it,0.244760320877
1096,TRUMP, Have you seen it,0.244760320877
1097,WALLACE, Sir,-0.115239679123
1098,TRUMP, Have you seen what's happening to Aleppo,0.10122313218
1099,WALLACE, Sir if I may finish my question,0.221903178019
1100,TRUMP, OK so it hasn't fallen,-0.659239679123
1101,TRUMP, Take a look at it,-0.199239679123
1102,WALLACE, Well there are a quarter of a million people still living there and being slaughtered,0.279109632818
1103,TRUMP, That's right,0.534760320877
1104,TRUMP, And they are being slaughtered,0.0678082567013
1105,WALLACE, Yes,1.36476032088
1106,TRUMP, because of bad decisions,-0.835239679123
1107,WALLACE, If I may just finish here and you also said that -- that Syria and Russia are busy fighting ISIS,-0.0999537272549
1108,WALLACE, In fact they have been the ones who've been bombing and shelling eastern Aleppo and they just announced a humanitarian pause in effect admitting that they have been bombing and shelling Aleppo,-0.191905999315
1109,WALLACE, Would you like to clear that up sir,0.432260320877
1110,TRUMP, Well Aleppo is a disaster,-0.488191743299
1111,TRUMP, It's a humanitarian nightmare,-0.921429759343
1112,TRUMP, But it has fallen from the -- from any standpoint,-0.448191743299
1113,TRUMP, I mean what do you need a signed document,-0.0863507902345
1114,TRUMP, Take a look at Aleppo,-0.128191743299
1115,TRUMP, It is so sad when you see what's happened,-0.404128568012
1116,TRUMP,And a lot of this is because of Hillary Clinton because what's happened is by fighting Assad who turned out to be a lot tougher than she thought and now she's going to say oh he loves Assad she's -- he's just much tougher and much smarter than her and Obama,-0.0483487364814
1117,TRUMP, And everyone thought he was gone two years ago three years ago,-0.158573012457
1118,TRUMP, He -- he aligned with Russia,0.0931735472511
1119,TRUMP,He now also aligned with Iran who we made very powerful,0.32796392807
1120,TRUMP, We gave them $150 billion back,0.57063360073
1121,TRUMP, We give them $17 billion in cash,0.866937417894
1122,TRUMP, I mean cash,0.29809365421
1123,TRUMP, Bundles of cash as big as this stage,0.271665280767
1124,TRUMP, We gave them $17 billion,0.723808256701
1125,TRUMP,Now they have -- he has aligned with Russia and with Iran,0.0539669340638
1126,TRUMP, They don't want ISIS but they have other things because we're backing -- we're backing rebels,-0.172679759343
1127,TRUMP, We don't know who the rebels are,-0.286668250552
1128,TRUMP, We're giving them lots of money lots of everything,0.524760320877
1129,TRUMP, We don't know who the rebels are,-0.286668250552
1130,TRUMP, And when and if -- and it's not going to happen because you have Russia and you have Iran now,-0.119477695167
1131,TRUMP, But if they ever did overthrow Assad you might end up with -- as bad as Assad is and he's a bad guy but you may very well end up with worse than Assad,-0.235939726311
1132,TRUMP,If she did nothing we'd be in much better shape,0.132760320877
1133,TRUMP, And this is what's caused the great migration where she's taking in tens of thousands of Syrian refugees who probably in many cases -- not probably who are definitely,-0.110214884731
1134,WALLACE, Let me,0.604760320877
1135,TRUMP, in many cases ISIS-aligned and we now have them in our country and wait until you see -- this is going to be the great Trojan horse,0.200527692631
1136,TRUMP, And wait until you see what happens in the coming years,-0.120694224578
1137,TRUMP, Lots of luck Hillary,0.524760320877
1138,TRUMP, Thanks a lot for doing a great job,0.652260320877
1139,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton you have talked about -- and in the last debate and again today -- that you would impose a no-fly zone to try to protect the people of Aleppo and to stop the killing there,-0.166565119218
1140,WALLACE, President Obama has refused to do that because he fears it's going to draw us closer or deeper into the conflict,-0.284763488647
1141,WALLACE,And General Joseph Dunford the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff says you impose a no-fly zone chances are you're going to get into a war -- his words -- with Syria and Russia,-0.133062582106
1142,WALLACE, So the question I have is if you impose a no-fly zone -- first of all how do you respond to their concerns,-0.0400014461562
1143,WALLACE, Secondly if you impose a no-fly zone and a Russian plane violates that does President Clinton shoot that plane down,-0.183953727255
1144,CLINTON, Well Chris first of all I think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict,0.0862117188883
1145,CLINTON, I'm well aware of the really legitimate concerns that you have expressed from both the president and the general,0.125812952456
1146,CLINTON,This would not be done just on the first day,0.212760320877
1147,CLINTON, This would take a lot of negotiation,-0.0959197249629
1148,CLINTON, And it would also take making it clear to the Russians and the Syrians that our purpose here was to provide safe zones on the ground,0.0574710654245
1149,CLINTON,We've had millions of people leave Syria and those millions of people inside Syria who have been dislocated,0.136189156286
1150,CLINTON, So I think we could strike a deal and make it very clear to the Russians and the Syrians that this was something that we believe was in the best interests of the people on the ground in Syria it would help us with our fight against ISIS,0.0223794674885
1151,CLINTON,But I want to respond to what Donald said about refugees,-0.331603315487
1152,CLINTON, He's made these claims repeatedly,-0.255239679123
1153,CLINTON, I am not going to let anyone into this country who is not vetted who we do not have confidence in,-0.0697520753556
1154,CLINTON, But I am not going to slam the door on women and children,-0.0552396791234
1155,CLINTON, That picture of that little 4-year-old boy in Aleppo with the blood coming down his face while he sat in an ambulance is haunting,-0.29063637253
1156,CLINTON, And so we are going to do very careful thorough vetting,0.0766220807172
1157,CLINTON, That does not solve our internal challenges with ISIS and our need to stop radicalization to work with American Muslim communities who are on the front lines to identify and prevent attacks,-0.143662199178
1158,CLINTON, In fact the killer of the dozens of people at the nightclub in Orlando the Pulse nightclub was born in Queens the same place Donald was born,-0.0200367399291
1159,CLINTON, So let's be clear about what the threat is and how we are best going to be able to meet it,-0.0114301553139
1160,CLINTON,And yes some of that threat emanates from over in Syria and Iraq and we've got to keep fighting and I will defeat ISIS and some of it is we have to up our game and be much smarter here at home,-0.0990263763498
1161,WALLACE, Folks I want to get into our final segment,0.19809365421
1162,TRUMP, But I just have to,-0.0312396791234
1163,WALLACE, Real quick,1.02476032088
1164,TRUMP, It's so ridiculous what she -- she will defeat ISIS,-0.266191743299
1165,TRUMP, We should have never let ISIS happen in the first place,0.0497821098878
1166,TRUMP, And right now they're in 32 countries,0.275508846466
1167,WALLACE, OK,0.564760320877
1168,TRUMP, We should have -- wait one second,-0.0416340106772
1169,TRUMP, They had a cease-fire three weeks ago,-0.141634010677
1170,TRUMP, A cease-fire the United States Russia and Syria,0.206070240657
1171,TRUMP, And during the cease-fire Russia took over vast swatches of land and then they said we don't want the cease-fire anymore,-0.125443534487
1172,TRUMP,We are so outplayed on missiles on cease-fires,-0.211429759343
1173,TRUMP, They are outplayed,0.00984021391772
1174,TRUMP, Now she wasn't there,-0.0102396791234
1175,TRUMP, I assume she had nothing to do with it,-0.159684123568
1176,TRUMP, But our country is so outplayed by Putin and Assad and by the way -- and by Iran,-0.181853083763
1177,TRUMP, Nobody can believe how stupid our leadership is,-0.240239679123
1178,WALLACE, Mister Trump Secretary Clinton -- no we need to move on to our final segment and that is the national debt which has not been discussed until tonight,-0.211838262012
1179,WALLACE,Our national debt as a share of the economy our GDP is now 77 percent,-0.0585410552403
1180,WALLACE, That's the highest since just after World War II,-0.210795234679
1181,WALLACE, But the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget says Secretary Clinton under your plan debt would rise to 86 percent of GDP over the next 10 years,-0.180919724963
1182,WALLACE, Mister Trump under your plan they say it would rise to 105 percent of GDP over the next 10 years,-0.0209537272549
1183,WALLACE, The question is why are both of you ignoring this problem,-0.304763344658
1184,WALLACE, Mister Trump you go first,0.492760320877
1185,TRUMP, Well I say they're wrong because I'm going to create tremendous jobs,0.259760320877
1186,TRUMP, And we're bringing GDP from really 1 percent which is what it is now and if she got in it will be less than zero,-0.133220504794
1187,TRUMP, But we're bringing it from 1 percent up to 4 percent,-0.0542870101919
1188,TRUMP, And I actually think we can go higher than 4 percent,0.269782109888
1189,TRUMP, I think you can go to 5 percent or 6 percent,0.162076626172
1190,TRUMP, And if we do you don't have to bother asking your question because we have a tremendous machine,0.0280936542099
1191,TRUMP, We will have created a tremendous economic machine once again,0.358760320877
1192,TRUMP, To do that we're taking back jobs,0.053331749448
1193,TRUMP, We're not going to let our companies be raided by other countries where we lose all our jobs we don't make our product anymore,-0.0296046924933
1194,TRUMP, It's very sad,-0.915239679123
1195,TRUMP, But I'm going to create a -- the kind of a country that we were from the standpoint of industry,0.0512842887889
1196,TRUMP, We used to be there,-0.0272396791234
1197,TRUMP, We've given it up,0.254760320877
1198,TRUMP, We've become very very sloppy,0.411808256701
1199,TRUMP,We've had people that are political hacks making the biggest deals in the world bigger than companies,0.108009713766
1200,TRUMP, You take these big companies these trade deals are far bigger than these companies and yet we don't use our great leaders many of whom back me and many of whom back Hillary I must say,0.103649209765
1201,TRUMP, But we don't use those people,-0.198573012457
1202,TRUMP, Those are the people -- these are the greatest negotiators in the world,0.124027963819
1203,TRUMP, We have the greatest businesspeople in the world,0.476665280767
1204,TRUMP, We have to use them to negotiate our trade deals,0.380760320877
1205,TRUMP,We use political hacks,0.00357024065744
1206,TRUMP, We use people that get the position because they gave -- they made a campaign contribution and they're dealing with China and people that are very much smarter than they are,0.178646751788
1207,TRUMP, So we have to use our great people,0.627260320877
1208,TRUMP,But that being said we will create an economic machine the likes of which we haven't seen in many decades,0.0797603208766
1209,TRUMP, And people Chris will again go back to work and they'll make a lot of money,0.178510320877
1210,TRUMP, And we'll have companies that will grow and expand and start from new,0.324760320877
1211,WALLACE, Secretary Clinton,0.174760320877
1212,CLINTON, Well first when I hear Donald talk like that and know that his slogan is "Make America Great Again" I wonder when he thought America was great,0.576083248187
1213,CLINTON, And before he rushes and says "You know before you and President Obama were there" I think it's important to recognize that he has been criticizing our government for decades,0.0514589447597
1214,CLINTON,You know back in 1987 he took out a $100000 ad in the New York Times during the time when President Reagan was president and basically said exactly what he just said now that we were the laughingstock of the world,0.0312412730076
1215,CLINTON, He was criticizing President Reagan,-0.156191743299
1216,CLINTON, This is the way Donald thinks about himself puts himself into you know the middle and says "You know I alone can fix it" as he said on the convention stage,0.0238080421104
1217,CLINTON,But if you look at the debt which is the issue you asked about Chris I pay for everything I'm proposing,-0.206894932498
1218,CLINTON, I do not add a penny to the national debt,-0.201239679123
1219,CLINTON, I take that very seriously because I do think it's one of the issues we've got to come to grips with,-0.0449901705937
1220,CLINTON,So when I talk about how we're going to pay for education how we're going to invest in infrastructure how we're going to get the cost of prescription drugs down and a lot of the other issues that people talk to me about all the time I've made it very clear we are going where the money is,-0.0340245177743
1221,CLINTON, We are going to ask the wealthy and corporations to pay their fair share,0.207617463734
1222,CLINTON,And there is no evidence whatsoever that that will slow down or diminish our growth,-0.283874388574
1223,CLINTON, In fact I think just the opposite,0.147617463734
1224,CLINTON, We'll have what economists call middle-out growth,0.172651703609
1225,CLINTON, We've got to get back to rebuilding the middle class the families of America,0.175848869385
1226,CLINTON, That's where growth will come from,0.27809365421
1227,CLINTON, That's why I want to invest in you,0.277260320877
1228,CLINTON, I want to invest in your family,0.630474606591
1229,CLINTON,And I think that's the smartest way to grow the economy to make the economy fairer,-0.065834719233
1230,CLINTON, And we just have a big disagreement about this,0.206453618557
1231,CLINTON, It may be because of our experiences,0.127617463734
1232,CLINTON, You know he started off with his dad as a millionaire,0.457487593604
1233,TRUMP, Yeah yeah we've heard -- we've heard this before Hillary,0.0662842887889
1234,CLINTON, I started off with -- my dad was a small-business man,0.200258444354
1235,TRUMP, We've heard this before,-0.0902396791234
1236,CLINTON, And I think it -- you know it's a difference that affects how we see the world and what we want to do with the economy,0.0797787577322
1237,WALLACE, Time,0.364760320877
1238,TRUMP, Thank you Hillary,0.87809365421
1239,TRUMP, Could I just respond,0.369760320877
1240,WALLACE, Well no sir because we're running out of time,-0.16190634579
1241,TRUMP, Because I did disagree with Ronald Reagan very strongly on trade,0.0556694117857
1242,TRUMP, I disagreed with him,0.263570240657
1243,TRUMP, We should have been much tougher on trade even then,0.250284288789
1244,TRUMP, I've been waiting for years,-0.415239679123
1245,TRUMP, Nobody does it right,-0.270239679123
1246,WALLACE, OK,0.564760320877
1247,TRUMP, And frankly now we're going to do it right,0.148675840779
1248,WALLACE, All right,1.00476032088
1249,WALLACE, The one last area I want to get into with you in this debate is the fact that the biggest driver of our debt is entitlements which is 60 percent of all federal spending,-0.113166756822

1262,TRUMP, If we don't repeal and replace -- now it's probably going to die of its own weight,-0.381682069815

1264,TRUMP, It's -- the premiums are going up 60 percent 70 percent 80 percent,-0.0309167256144
