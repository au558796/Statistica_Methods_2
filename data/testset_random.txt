The small and the big triangle was bouncing from side to side in the video. Each time they hit a side of they screen they were rotated about 10 degrees and this kept on going for the duration of the video. In the middle there was still the incomplete square and the small triangle was located over it while the big triangle was located below it.
The red and the blue triangle were outside the square. The were on each side of the square, moving horisontal in the frame, always following each other. They moved right and left, bouncing of the side of the frame. They appeared to be trying to mirror each other, but it was unclear which one of them were the "leader" and who was the "follower". Everytime they bounced back from the frame, they spinned around a little. 
The small triangle was on the top, the red was in the bottom. They were both just bouncing around and their angle changed with each bounce. In the end they escaped and floated away in the same direction.
First the big triangle would follow the moves of the little triangle but later the positions change, so now the little triangle will follow in the footsteps of the big triangle. 
Two triangles, one little white and one large red are on each side of an incomplete box. A very large box sorrounds them. The white one is above while the red one is below the box. They are moving horizontally back and forth, and hitting the walls of the large box, just like the old DVD logo that was bouncing off the walls of the tv screen. They continue to do this for the rest of the video.
The two triangles are drifting around, jumping back whenever they hit a wall. The black triangle is in the top of the big square and the red triangle is in the bottom. At some point it looks like the red square is sort of mimicking the black square but after a while it just looks random again. They never hit the smaller square in the middle and never enter it, but when they hit the walls of the larger square they don't really move in the direction they logically should have if they had hit the wall that way (like when they hit the wall with a corner first they should then hit the wall with the side and jump back out from that angle).
So the two triangles were moving horizontally from one edge of the big box to the other, changing their orientation whenever they hit the wall. in the end of the video they went out of the screen even though it had seemed like the outer box was solid all through the video. The triangles movements seemed like some kinda reminded me of the bubbles on the pause screen of some computers.
In this video two triangles are situated outside of the quadrant with the hole in the right side. throughout the video the two triangles moved a bit up and down, but otherwise just kept going horizontally, although in different "rhythms". 
There are two triangles flying around inside a box. Between them there is another box but this box has an opening. The two triangles fly around, every time they hit the sides of the box which they are inside, they turn a bit. The purpose of flying around isn't clear. Do they want to enter the box or do they want to meet each other. 
The triangles are inside a bigger box. In the middle, there is a box that looks the one from the previous video, only it seems smaller. The triangles are sliding from side to side, often, though not always, rotating a few degrees when they hit one of the sides of the box. At the end of the video, the triangles slide through the right side of the box and dissappear from sight.
Two triangles bounce from side to side. One is a small blue triangle and the other is a larger red triangle. There is a square between then with part of a side missing indicating a door. The blue triangle is above the square and the red below. They appear to rotate about 30 degrees every so often while trying to mimic the rotation of the other. There is no clear leader of the rotation, but it seems they may take turns in leading. After bouncing back and forth for a while they both exit out the right side of frame.
Two triangles were moving around inside a quadratic line - from left to right, always turning about 45 degrees whenever hitting a wall. And they hit the wall, every time, they reached the left or right side of the quadratic line. 
The triangles are behaving like balls on a pool table. They are bouncing from each side of the screen onto the next, following laws which ball a pool table would follow. Though there is some few exceptions to this rule over the duration of the video.
The two triangles were bouncing randomly gainst the frame. They seemed to move independently from one another. A couple of times they were very, very close to culminate, but they never did. After some bouncing they flew off, outside the frame.
Both triangles were just bouncing around. They never met. They might have been looking for the right spot, where they could leave the place and in the end they finally did it.
I think this is an analogue for siblings getting closer as they get older, because though they might start out very differently, they have to confront the same challenges and have to deal with the samme difficult stages of youth ( the sides of the square) and so they grow closer and closer as their starting point in life provide them with the same backpack of similar experiences. 
A red and a white triangle, the red bigger than the white, bounce off the sides of a box. Imagine the old DVD logo, which you watched and hoped it would eventually hit a corner perfectly. These triangles act just like the logo. Except in the end when they suddenly move back and forth before exiting the frame.
The two triangles are floating around in the large square, bouncing off the walls when they hit them. The red square starts at the top and the black square starts at the bottom of the square. First, they float horizontally until they hit a wall and change direction. The two triangles never touch each other, as if they were floating in their own "bubble". They get really close at one point but still don't notice each other. In the end, they float out of the square, not regarding the walls that they previously bounced off of. 
In this video the two triangles went all in on acting like pause screen bubbles, i.e. they they hit the edges of the big box, changed orientation and then bounced of the edge floating in a straight line until they hit another edge repeating the process. In the end they just flew straight through the edges of the box.
In this video there are 2 triangles, one bigger and one smaller one. In this video thy move in a confirmed space, and bounce off the wall when hit it, just like a tennis ball. or pool table where you may use the banter+?
Inside a box there are two triangles. They are flying around and they never meet. The route they are flying shifts every time the hit the sides of the box. They are very close to meeting each other, but still so far away. 
The triangles are sliding around the box, seemingly randomly, hitting the corners and making slight rotations, changing their trajectory. The often come close to hitting each other, but never quite. At the end of the video, they slide through the sides of the box and dissappear off screen.
The big, red triangle and the small, blue triangle bounce around the sides of the frame whilst intermittently rotating. It appears that they are dancing in a waltz-type dance around the screen.
Two triangles were floating around inside of a quadratic line. They hit the walls and flew off the walls in the angle they hit them. They never touched each other. At the end, they floated out of the quadratic line.
The triangels are behaving like ball on a pool table again. (I don't what is wrong with them, they used to be so lively? Maybe they are sick?)  They are bouncing from the sides of the screen into either another side of the screen of into the incomplete box in the middle. This goes on for the duration of the video.
Once again the trangles were bouncing against the frame of the video. This time the square was there again, so they were bouncing against that too. They were very, very close crashing into each other, but they never did. They just moved in the same space, but never directly interacting. 
Both triangles were just bouncing around. They might have been searching the exit but they didn't find it. They were moving al around the place, they were close to each other but never met.
I think this is an analogy for that siblings can go through their entire life without ever crossing each others paths when they have left home, but they are both to some degree marked by their experiences/childhood/past so they will circle around the same choices and decisions in life and just barely miss each other. 
A small white and a big red triangle are outside a box with a hole in the side. They bounce aimlessly off the walls of the box and the outer frame of the video. This goes on for some time, whereafter the video stops.
There is the smaller square with the open wall inside the larger square. The two triangles are floating around, bouncing of the walls of both the larger square and the smaller square. They never hit each other and never notice each other. It's like they're still in their own "bubble". Not much else is happening in the video.
In this video, the triangles again kept bouncing of the edges of the big box, the three main differences being that this time the center box was also there, giving them all new bounce opportunities, they slowed down towards the end of the video and they stayed inside the big box.
There are two triangles in this movie, one bigger one (red) and one smaller one (blue) there is also a quadrant in the middle which the two triangles are circling bouncing back and forth between the walls and the quadrant. The blue/small triangle is going clockwise and the red/ big triangle is going anti-clockwise
Two triangles flying around, might be in space. Every time they hit the box surrounding them or the box in the middle, they flip around. 

The two triangles bounce around the screen while rotating intermittently. There is a square in the middle of the screen. The triangles bounce between the sides of the screen as well as the square in the middle. 
Two triangles were moving around inside of a quadratic line. They hit that line and another one, which was inside of that quadratic line (which had a room-like shape). Both triangles never hit each other, only the walls.
