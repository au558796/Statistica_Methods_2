I saw two triangles in an incomplete box. One of the triangles was big and one was small. The two danced around inside the box and then the big triangle urged the small one to come out of the box and dance. The small triangle was shy and therefore didn't want to come out and play. The big triangle then went inside the house to and forced the small triangle out. In the end the two of them was dancing happily outside the box.
There were two triangles; a big red one and a small blue one. They were inside a square. There was an opening in the square. The blue triangle wanted to dance with the red one. So they did. Then the red triangle went outside of the square. The blue one didn't want it to leave, so it tried to pull it back. However, the red one went outside and it wanted the blue one to follow. The blue one was scared, it went into a corner for the square. The red one went into the square and gently pushed the blue one outside of the square. Once outside they performed their little dance again.  
The big red triangle tried to get the small triangle out but the only thing the small triangle wanted to do was kissing.(Meaning connecting) But then the big triangle managed to kick out the small one and rewarded it with the kiss. Then they were both happy and circled around.
The little triangle was scared to leave home, but then the big ( adult) triangle pushed it out of the home, so that the little triangle could learn that it was not dangerous outside. When the little triangle got scared the big triangle came out to the little triangle to show that it would always help the little triangle, and they they were dancing and hugging. The story is about children leaving the safe nest and being brave enough to go into the world on their own.
Two triangles are inside an incomplete box, one small white triangle and one red larger triangle. The red triangle seems to suggest that the little white triangle ventures out of the hole in the box. The white triangle is unwilling to do this, so the red triangle pushes the white out of the box and blocks the entrance. When the white triangle has realized that it is not dangerous out there, they grab each other and do a dance.
The little black triangle and the large red triangle are inside a sort of box. The black triangle wants to play with the red triangle, but the red triangle doesn't really want to play with the black triangle. The black triangle tries to interact with the red triangle, and the red triangle tries to push the black triangle out of the box. It succeeds, but the black triangle still tries to play with the red triangle. Then I don't remember the ending.
The two triangles seemed to be playing some kind of game at first where one of their corners touched and they spun around. Then the big triangle went outside the box for a short duration of time. After the big triangle had returned it pushed the little triangle out of the box. After the small triangle had wandered around for a little while, the big triangle came out and they played the game from the begining again.
In this video two triangles interact with one another inside a quadrant. The quadrant is complete exempt from a hole in the middle right line. The two pointy angles on the two triangles touch each other several times. One triangle is significantly bigger than the other. At some point the big triangle moves out of the box, but comes back and almost "push" the little triangle out of the quadrant- 
There are two triangles inside a box. The small triangle asks the large triangle to dance, so they dance. After the dance the large triangle goes outside the box. The small triangles doesn't want to. The large triangle reenter the box and force/helps the small triangle out of the box. When the small triangle gets out of the box, the large triangle blocks the entrance. The small triangle likes to be outside the box, so they dance again. 
Two triangles, one big and one small, are in a box. The triangles join together at the top and start spinning around. The box has an opening that the big triangle uses to exit the box. A little later, it returns and the triangles start bumping into one another. In the end, the big triangle pushes the small one out of the box, after which they, once again, join together at the top and start spinning around, this time outside of the box.
A small, apprehensive, blue, isosceles triangle tries everything it can to not leave its square room whilst a bigger, red, isosceles triangle wants to leave with the blue triangle. The two triangles seem to get into a tussle with the blue triangle pulling on the red to stay in the room. They spin around trying to pull each other. Eventually the red triangle gets the blue triangle outside and blocks the entrance as to not let blue back in. They get into another spinning and pulling fight outside before the blue triangle concedes and stays outside. 
There are various ways to look at this. If one does not interpret anything, the video showed two triangles, one small, one big, moving around inside of a line, which had a shape of a room, looking at it from the top. The line was not closed, rather it had an opening. The triangles moved inside of this line and the big one moved outside a bit into the video. Eventually, the big one tried to push the small one outside (although that can already count as an interpretation - instead of a description). So going away from the descriptive side towards an interpretation, I think I saw two triangles, that interacted in a way that seemed like they were some kind of agent. They could be two persons or animals. The reason for this, is that their movements seemed very close to a situation in which for instance, a mother and a child are playing (when turning around a center point - as if holding each other's hands). Next, the mother agent (the big triangle) tries to get the small agent outside of the house (the line described above). But the child agent does not seem to want to go outside alone, since it is waiting for the other agent to come with him.
The big triangle was taking a walk. The small triangle sees this and mimics/follows the big triangle. When the big triangle tries to turn around and see what is happening behind it the small triangle looks away, pretending nothing happened. This goes on for one or two times until the big triangle discovers that the small triangle is following it and then the small triangle runs away.
The red triangle was walking. The blue triangle appeared and wanted to follow the red one. It ran to it and mirrored the red ones walk. The red one noticed the blue one and turned around, looking at it for a while. Then it turned away and contiuned walking. The blue followed again. Accidently, the blue one walked into the red one, and the red one turned around, being angry with the blue one. The blue one got scared and ran off. 
The red triangle was just walking slowly. Then the blue triangle came into the picture and started following the red one. When the red one turned around to check if someone was behind, the blue one acted as if it was doing something else. The blue did this twice, then on the thrid occasion it got busted but it just laughed, went away, stopped one more time before exiting, laughed again and then left.
This seemed to me as an analogue for behavement of siblings. The little triangle see the big triangle doing this really cool movement, and wants to do the same thing. So it copies the big triangels moves but try to hide that it is doing it, so the big triangle wont get mad, but then when the big triangle discovers that the little triangle is copying it, it yells at the small triangle and the small triangle yells back and runs away - probably in tears. 
A large red triangle is "walking" around inside a box. Suddenly a little white triangle enters the picture and starts following the red triangle and imitating its moves perfectly. The red triangle seems to notice that something is up and turns around, but when it turns the white triangle pretends to do nothing. This happens a couple of times until the white triangle accidentally bumps into the red one and it notices. The white triangle exits the frame.
The red triangle is sort of walking around in the square. Then the black triangle comes out and starts following the red triangle. But every time the red triangle stops and looks around to see if it is being followed, the black triangle stops and looks away as to show "no, I'm not following you". This goes on for a while and then the black triangle pokes the red triangle. Now the red triangle knows it's being followed and they sort of chase each other until the black triangle disappears out of the larger square. 
The big triangle was pulsating and walked around the edges of the big box. Then the small triangle came in from the bottom screen and rushed after the big triangle. When it caught up it started mimicking the big triangle. Sometimes it would bump into the big triangle and the big triangle would turn around. At some point the big triangle had enough and seemed to get angry. The little triangle fled when the big triangle got angry.
This movie shoes two triangles moving in a rectangular space. They are different sizes, one bigger than the other, but otherwise equal in shape. they take turns "following each other" but mostly with the small one in front. The other one then follow  sonly with the pointy tail The n the end the blue / small triangle hurries out of the picture/video.
Inside a box we see a large triangle which is moving around. Then appears a smaller triangle and it starts to imitate the large triangle. Being followed or imitated is not fun, so the large triangle turns around and confronts the small triangle. After having sone this a couple of times the large triangle, has had enough. Therefore it shouts at the small triangle, so it runs away. 
At the beginning, we see only the big triangle, moving around inside the box. However, after a few seconds, the small one emerges from one of the sides of the box, right behind the big triangle and starts following it closely. However, from time to time, the big triangle turns around, as if looking, making the small triangle also turn away, as if trying to hide the fact that it is following the big one. In the end, the small triangle bumps into the big one, making it turn around, shaking, as if angry. The small triangle then darts away, stops, and then also starts shaking, as if it is afraid.
The big, red triangle is minding his own business, happily pulsating and marching around the edges of the frame. The small, blue triangle comes in and notices the red triangle. Blue decides to mock Red by following closely behind and pulsating in a mimicking way. Red has a suspicion that somebody is behind and turns around, but Blue quickly turns away and pretends not to be paying attention. As soon as Red turns around and resumes, Blue continues to follow behind and imitate Red. After a while Red turns around again and Blue does the same as before, pretending not to notice until Red continues on again. Blue, following closely behind, doesn't notice when Red stops to check behind again causing Blue to run into the back of Red. Blue being scared of Red after being caught runs away off the left of the frame.
Two triangles were interacting with each other. The bigger one went around in circles, when the smaller one joined him, following him and doing the exact same movements as the other one. That is, whenever the bigger one stopped, the smaller one stopped. Whenever the bigger one turned around, the smaller one turned around also. At some point, the smaller one bumps into the bigger one, and the bigger one turns to him. That is when the smaller one goes away quickly. 
The small triangle is held hostage by the big triangle inside the incomplete square. The big triangle is blocking the entrance so that the small triangle can't get out. The small triangle then tries to tickle the big triangle but it is then pushed back into the square and then it goes sulk in the corner. The big triangle goes to comfort it, but it was fooled! The little triangle escapes the big triangle and is now free!!
The two triangles were in the corner of the frame. They looked like they were arguing. The red triangle pushed the blue one into the square, blocking the exit, forcing it to stay inside the square. The blue one tried to break free, but the red one was too strong (and too big), so it went to the corner of the square, thinking and planing what to do. It then tried to approach the red one with a friendly attitude. It didn't help; the red one, still wouldn't move. The blue one went back to the corner, were it began to cry. The red one ran to it, checking if it was okay; then the blue one ran outside the sqaure, escaping. The red one tried to follow, but lost track of the blue one. It got mad (or maybe sad) 
The big triangle tried to keep the small one inside the room. The small one tried to escape but couldn't find any way. Then it changed its strategie. It started to pet the big triangle, lured it into the room, then kissed it. When the big triangle went for another kiss, the small one just compassed it and escaped the room. Then escaped the place. And the red triangle was left alone and had no clue where the blue triangle went.
So the little triangle is teasing the big triangle. The big triangle take revenge by using its bigger size to trap the little triangle. The little triangle tries to hit the big triangle so it will let it out, but it dosent work. Then the small triangle uses a different approach. It tickles the big triangle until it eases up, and then run to a corner and pretend to be crying. When the big triangle comes to comfort the small triangle, the small triangle runs out of the room and hides. 
A large red and a small white triangle are in the frame. In the frame is also an incomplete box (with a hole in the side). The big red triangle pushes the white triangle into the box and blocks the hole so that it cannot escape. The white triangle hits the red one to try and get out, but to no avail. It starts moving one of its edges up and down the red triangles side, and they eventually stand edge to edge. The little while triangle moves in the corner and the red follows, whereafter the white hurries out the box and exits the frame.
There is a smaller square with an open wall inside the larger square where the two triangles also are. The two triangles are stuck together. The red triangle takes the black triangle inside the smaller square and the black square lets go. Then, the red square blocks the exit so that the black square can't get out. It tries to poke the red triangle but it doesn't work. It stops for a while, and then tries again, this time sort of stroking the red triangle. It works and the red triangle moves so that the exit is open. I can't exactly remember what happens next but I think the two squares sort of make up and dance around inside the smaller square. But then the black square disappears out of the larger square and it looks like the red triangle tries to follow it and thinks "where did you go?".
In this video, the big triangle pushed the little triangle into the box in the center and blocked the exit. The little triangle started to shake and tried to get out. At one point it was just shaking in the lower left corner. After it some time trying to get out it went to the upper left corner and started shaking there. The big triangle then approached it and also shook a little. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, the little triangle ran out of the box and out of the screen. The big triangle followed outside, but couldn't see/find the little triangle, as it had already left the screen.
In this movie there are two triangles one big and one small. There is also a quadrant with a hole in the right side, which the little triangle is trying to come out from. The big triangle blocks the little triangle's way out, but in the end the little triangle comes out.
This is the opposite of video 1. The large triangle pushes the small triangle into the box and blocks the exit. The small triangle really wants to go outside of the box. First it goes to the corner, then it tickles the large triangle. This works and they both go into the corner. The small triangle fools the large triangle and runs out of the box. Now the large triangle is confused, where did it go?
The big triangle pushes the small one into the small box with an opening on its right side. It blocks the opening, so that the small triangle can't escape. After unsuccesfully trying to get the big triangle to move by continuously bumping into it, the small triangle faces away and slides into a corner. After a short while, it slides back to the big triangle, touches it, and starts sliding up and down its side, perhaps tickling it. This seems to make the big triangle angry, and the small triangle is pushed into a corner of the box. However, it moves around the big triangle and manages to escape.
Red pushes Blue into their square room. Red blocks the door while Blue tries to find any way to slip out. Blue tries tickling Red to get him to move. Red finally pushes Blue into the corner and tries to talk to him, but blue escapes while Red is distracted. Red rushes out of the room to try to find where Blue went.
The bigger triangle pushed the smaller triangle into a room-shaped line (view from the top.) Then the smaller triangle tried to escape this "room". But the bigger one would not let him, blocking the only exit. The smaller triangle tried other ways to get out - bumping into the bigger one, going close to the bigger one - seemingly touching him softly - going into the corner of the room, facing away from the bigger one. That is when the bigger one goes close to the smaller one and the smaller one finally escapes.
